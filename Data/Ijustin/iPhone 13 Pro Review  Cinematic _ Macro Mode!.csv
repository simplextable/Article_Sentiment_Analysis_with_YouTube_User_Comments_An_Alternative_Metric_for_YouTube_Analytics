"Very good review, you really break the narrative and actually show the differences instead of just saying that there is nothing new. For quick videos with two people and without a crew the cinematic function is pretty completing. One can just turn the bokeh effect off if it's too much.  The new cameras look good.

"really excited for this. I am one of those people that switch every so often to Android. But I have owned basically every iPhone except the 12.  I traded in my 11 pro for the Galaxy Z fold2. The fold has its issues. its delicate. The folding screen is starting to crack down the middle from folding in less than a year.   When you open it its basically a tablet, and closed its a phone. And that messes with apps badly. They need to be restarted or restart themselves when you open and close the phone. its annoying.  Cool concept. But its not perfect yet.

"going from the 11 pro max to the 13 pro max i think its  definitely an upgrade and a style change which i kinda hate but will learn to love. the only reason i was going to upgrade was because of the camera, i use it the most out of anything on my phone and always take cute family photos when i have the chance. i love that it replaces basically a DSLR type camera and gives me exactly what i want without having to lugging the heavy camera around and fits in my pocket. never really bought the Apple Mac safe silicone and leather phone cases because i thought it was an unnecessary expense added on to the phone but couldn't pass up on the wisteria colored leather case paired with the sierra blue.  Overall IN LOVE with it so far since i've had it for 3 days. ",B A Y,10 ay √∂nce,0

"GENUINE POV: I bought the iPhone XS Max the day it came out 3 years ago and it STILL takes the same quality photos as the new iPhone 13 Pro Max. I tried it at Apple store last Friday here in SF. Apple is good at sprinkling new features onto their camera but at its core most of us stick to XS Max for a reason. The inky colors and clarity is no different than the new iPhone on a normal photo. But Apple needs to make money so marketing is their best friend. PLUS I still get all day battery life (this is my primary computer), it even has zero scratches on my case-less phone and WEIRDLY enough in direct sunlight side by side my 625 nits of brightness screen was brighter than the 1000 / 1200 nits of brightness screen on the new iPhone. Even an apple employee thought that was strange. Perhaps it‚Äôs the type of screen? The new iPhone is definitely worth getting if you have an iPhone 8 or less.

"Justine, you honestly convinced me to buy the iPhone 13. Up until now, i still got the iPhone X from 2017 but my battery had taken some hits lately. Still though, i wasn't really convinced to buy one even though i said i would buy the next iPhone if it had 120Hz. display. I don't know why but i wasn't a fan of the new colors and i heard that the iPhone 14 was getting rid of the notch. Then again, we heard this a couple of times already and even if true, i couldn't go a whole year with my iPhone X anymore because of the battery. So better to buy one now and enjoy the whole year from a much newer and faster iPhone (over the iPhone X) than having to buy one suddenly because my iPhone decides to just give up a month before the new one releases (which happened to me with the iPhone 5 and i needed to buy the iPhone 6).

Cinematic & Macro are the two take aways and I'm sure Apple is going to work a bit more on fine-tuning them as reviews from professional cinematographers have not been great so far.

"11:17 I really don't like that Apple uses fantasy f-numbers. The 13 Pro main camera hardware is approximately equivalent to a full frame camera with 26mm f/6.7 lens. So f/16 should actually lead to much less background blur than the default non-portrait mode. Even the ultra wide angle camera is equivalent to a full frame camera + 13mm f/15 lens. The only explanation would be if they compare it with large format cameras instead of full frame (but I guess that this isn't the case either as I assume that every iPhone camera has the ""f/16"" setting )",Quoutub,11 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),0

After that I remember we went for a walk on the beach holding hands all 3 of us. Last thing I remember is that I saw your face and I grab your check and admire those beautiful blue eyes and then I woke up. This felt so real like you and I were actually together with that  beautiful child. Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I dreamt with you as I don‚Äôt know you in person, I only watch your videos but I must say that your an incredible beautiful woman and I wish my dream could someone become true, but that‚Äôs nearly impossible because I know you would not even read this message much less reply to it.
