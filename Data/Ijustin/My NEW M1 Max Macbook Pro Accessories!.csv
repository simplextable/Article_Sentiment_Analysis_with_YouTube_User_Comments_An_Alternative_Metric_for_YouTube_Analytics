"Really considering this keyboard, looks neat! On a completely irrelevant side note: The amount of content creators I see who were glad the TouchBar has gone have their MacBook closed and plugged into a monitor ",Eric Cartman,9 ay önce,100
"The MX Keys Mini is a lovely keyboard. I'm very happy with mine. My only criticism is Logitech's decision to go for non-standard F-keys. Not having the normal shortcuts for screen brightness, launchpad, and mission control is a little annoying. You can remap the F-keys in Logitech Options, but standard Mac F-keys would've been better. Other than that, it's great to type on and looks lovely.",Ben Adamson,9 ay önce,31

"Great vid!  Thanks for the tour of your space and accessories, Justine.  I have the gray and white logitech keyboard and love it.  My only concern is that it doesn't have computer brightness settings, which is a strange choice to have left off the keyboard.  It's easy enough to go to the control center, but it would be quicker to have it on the keyboard.  Otherwise, I love it.",Dennis Perkins,9 ay önce,1

You most likely won’t see this message but I Have always been a fan of your YouTube videos and I was wondering if you could help me out ! I’m having a hard time getting a hold of the new Nintendo Switch Oled version  my old Nintendo switch lite was stolen from me unfortunately and really want to get my hands on the new version. I’m okay if it’s used ! I just really want it and haven’t had any luck finding it ",Janett Guajardo,9 ay önce,0

IJustine  why do you choose to ignore the ethics of apple products. I want to hear your views on the issue. They are currently exploiting people across sees and that’s not okay. I understand you like apple products and I’m not asking you to stop. But as an influencer you should let your viewers know the whole picture of these products. You are a wonderful person and I just wanted you to know what you are promoting.,Jesus,8 ay önce,0

I find it surreal that Logitech is sponsoring a M1 MacBook Pro video while not even having a software that works on it yet! I am a Logi user having the MX series and I’m so disappointed. I just installed a new M1 Pro Max and found out none of my devices will work unless I install Rosetta on it! So basically you invest on top gadgets and have to use a software to emulate an old intel based op to use your stuff… fantastically disappointing!,Maria Porto,9 ay önce,0

"The MX Keys Mini is a lovely keyboard. I'm very happy with mine. My only criticism is Logitech's decision to go for non-standard F-keys. Not having the normal shortcuts for screen brightness, launchpad, and mission control is a little annoying. You can remap the F-keys in Logitech Options, but standard Mac F-keys would've been better. Other than that, it's great to type on and looks lovely.",[MARIA]H0T Girl-C0me 0ver L!ve,9 ay önce,0
