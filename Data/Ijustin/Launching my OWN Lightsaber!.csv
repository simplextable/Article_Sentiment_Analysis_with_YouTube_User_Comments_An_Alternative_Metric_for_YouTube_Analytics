Still, this is way better than what I had back in the late 70s. Lightsabers back then consisted of a basic D cell powered torch with a long colored plastic tube connected to it, in either red or green. The light coming from the torch (flashlight in American) would barely spread up half said tube, while only really being visible in the dark. And let’s not even get started into how flimsy they were too…if you even tried to battle another person those tubes would just instantly break or something ",David Datura,8 ay önce (düzenlendi),3
