Another good feature with the Live Text is that you don‚Äôt even need to take a picture of what you plan to get a text from but just point your camera and press the live text button on the lower left screen and you‚Äôll be able to grab the text in an instant without actually taking a photo of it. Very useful feature indeed.,Steeephen,10 ay √∂nce,241

With every other video being saturated with ‚Äúreasons why you shouldn‚Äôt buy the iPhone 13‚Äù or ‚ÄúApple is giving us bs‚Äù, it is so refreshing to have a tech YouTuber who is just giving her opinions on the good things about the phone. I‚Äôm going from an iPhone SE 2020 and it‚Äôs my first iPhone I ever purchased and wanted to go to the 13 Pro Max. All the video I keep watching, looking for good reviews, always keep going back to why the phone sucks. Like I don‚Äôt have an iPhone 12 so for me that‚Äôs a big jump.
