"In MarioKart64 there are 8 players in a race. If you look carefully when iJustine is approaching the finish line you can only count out 7 circles moving on the map, which would mean Wario is right next to iJustine and Toad on the home stretch, though not seen on screen. Toad spins out just before the line and Wario must have crept unseen up the right hand side, leaving (ONE) frame between iJustine and the finish line, it still shows (Toad) who is a few frames behind after the spin in second, pressed against the bottom right of screen. (Yet) in that frame it also shows the position counter fading to second place. How? If Wario is still currently (within that one frame) in 3rd and Toad is a few frames behind in 2nd (shown on the heads up display) This would mean in one frame Wario sped a  good couple of frames past two players, Even if he is moving a frame or two faster at this point then iJustine  she has but one frame to move. Wario is shown in the next frame to be a good couple of frames in front of iJustine. JUST HOW FAST WAS WARIO GOING? The player position couldn't update in time.",M B,9 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),0
