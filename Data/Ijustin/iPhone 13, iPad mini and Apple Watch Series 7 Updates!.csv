"I'm really liking that iPad mini. Ohh... that's why Tim talked about fall detection when you asked him about bike riding. It's cause the video showed a bike rider falling down. I was like, ""huh?

"While I appreciate the notable upgrades this year, the 120hz refresh rates, smaller notch and camera upgrades, I’m sorely disappointed with the absence of always on display functionality. I’ve accepted the reality that Touch ID isn’t coming this year based on leaks and rumors but the least they could do is implement the always on display mode. I’m always leaning towards bigger screen phones and whether I’m getting this year’s iteration, Pro Max will always be my top choice and I was 100% sure that I’m grabbing it until I’ve watched live Apple event streaming. Felt it was underwhelming. I expected a lil bit more and I’m now confused whether I’ll scoop the 13 Pro Max or just wait for another year. I got let down once again.",Robert Louise Baker-Hyde,11 ay önce,51

"There once were two great imaginative innovators.  They didn't always get along, but both believed in their dreams.  One retired, the other died.  And their dream has been left in the hands of an accountant, who runs the company like an accountant would.  ""Updates"" instead of innovation, year after year after year.  I hope somewhere in this world there are two other young guys, working in their garage, with little funds, just a dream, who are inventing something that will inspire this world even further.  ""Apple"" is already 'old'.  It feels 'safe', like visiting your grandparents for Sunday dinner.  There must be today lots of Apple users who weren't even born when Steve Jobs was alive presenting his new ideas, wearing just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt - so cool.  I feel for them.  It's like those today trying to imagine what it must have been like to have been alive when the Beatles were a group, or even the Backstreet Boys were making their hits, or the Spice Girls - all from a long ago past era with only a Kardashian or a Jenner to inspire them now.",Mr Model,11 ay önce,0

Justine I’m sorry but I was not impressed at all with what I saw from this event. From someone that has been an Apple fan since the original iPhone theses product updates were very disappointing and limited. iPad Mini maybe being the only highlight of the keynote for me. I was expecting the Apple Watch honestly to be significantly updated and was expecting for a complete redesign of the Apple Watch. Guess the rumors were not accurate. Year after year I’m becoming less impressed and I feel innovation lately with Apple is limited. No wow factor for me.,Mike Schinella,11 ay önce,0

the NASDAQ plummeted today after the announcement by Apple. They say there was nothing revolutionary announced. Yes. No blood glucose monitoring for Apple Watch 7 and no redesign. The apple event was deliberately underwhelming. So millions of people worldwide who would’ve purchased an Apple Watch perhaps for the first time for health conditions like diabetes now have no incentive for buying one. The iPad and iPadOS remain stuck in order to protect and promote Mac sales. Apple has chosen to deliberately hold back the evolution of its iPads which it sees as being solely for media consumption and entertainment and let Macs continue to do the heavy lifting even though iPads are capable of so much more if only Apple allowed it. iPhones were an S year upgrade with nothing mind blowing in terms of features. All these many months of waiting with pent up expectations just be rewarded with a gentle letdown.,Graham Palmer,11 ay önce,1

"Hi Justine, why can’t you guys tell the truth to public. For last few years, Apple is zero on innovation. But you youtubers are always very excited about apple’s minor updates. If apple does a little, you all exaggerate the things. I understand you are apple pro. But it is also healthy to criticise them if they are lacking on innovation part.",anuj gupta,11 ay önce,0

"I enjoy your channel but I also see that you have 6.91 million followers. Which is very inconsistent with only having on your last 15 videos posted with only highest views of 300 thousand. What this tells me most of your followers are fake accounts or bots ! I follow other Youtubers with nowhere near 6.91 million followers that get twice the views of your videos. Having 6.91 million followers you would think having the Apple CEO in your video would have way more views than 300,000 !",Chris Slusher,11 ay önce,0
