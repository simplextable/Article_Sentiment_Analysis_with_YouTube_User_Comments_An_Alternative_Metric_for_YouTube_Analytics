"I'm really liking that iPad mini. Ohh... that's why Tim talked about fall detection when you asked him about bike riding. It's cause the video showed a bike rider falling down. I was like, ""huh? I ride a bike and I don't fall down. Does he think we fall down a lot? BMX yeah, but I don't do that."" Very good follow up video!",Sunfrog,11 ay √∂nce,95

"While I appreciate the notable upgrades this year, the 120hz refresh rates, smaller notch and camera upgrades, I‚Äôm sorely disappointed with the absence of always on display functionality. I‚Äôve accepted the reality that Touch ID isn‚Äôt coming this year based on leaks and rumors but the least they could do is implement the always on display mode. I‚Äôm always leaning towards bigger screen phones and whether I‚Äôm getting this year‚Äôs iteration, Pro Max will always be my top choice and I was 100% sure that I‚Äôm grabbing it until I‚Äôve watched live Apple event streaming. Felt it was underwhelming. I expected a lil bit more and I‚Äôm now confused whether I‚Äôll scoop the 13 Pro Max or just wait for another year. I got let down once again.",Robert Louise Baker-Hyde,11 ay √∂nce,51

"Please someone tell apple to add splitview on ipads when they are kept vertical, like one app on top of another.

"There once were two great imaginative innovators.  They didn't always get along, but both believed in their dreams.  One retired, the other died.  And their dream has been left in the hands of an accountant, who runs the company like an accountant would.  ""Updates"" instead of innovation, year after year after year.  I hope somewhere in this world there are two other young guys, working in their garage, with little funds, just a dream, who are inventing something that will inspire this world even further.  ""Apple"" is already 'old'.  It feels 'safe', like visiting your grandparents for Sunday dinner.  There must be today lots of Apple users who weren't even born when Steve Jobs was alive presenting his new ideas, wearing just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt - so cool.  I feel for them.  It's like those today trying to imagine what it must have been like to have been alive when the Beatles were a group, or even the Backstreet Boys were making their hits, or the Spice Girls - all from a long ago past era with only a Kardashian or a Jenner to inspire them now.",Mr Model,11 ay √∂nce,0

the NASDAQ plummeted today after the announcement by Apple. They say there was nothing revolutionary announced. Yes. No blood glucose monitoring for Apple Watch 7 and no redesign. The apple event was deliberately underwhelming. So millions of people worldwide who would‚Äôve purchased an Apple Watch perhaps for the first time for health conditions like diabetes now have no incentive for buying one. The iPad and iPadOS remain stuck in order to protect and promote Mac sales. Apple has chosen to deliberately hold back the evolution of its iPads which it sees as being solely for media consumption and entertainment and let Macs continue to do the heavy lifting even though iPads are capable of so much more if only Apple allowed it. iPhones were an S year upgrade with nothing mind blowing in terms of features. All these many months of waiting with pent up expectations just be rewarded with a gentle letdown.,Graham Palmer,11 ay √∂nce,1
