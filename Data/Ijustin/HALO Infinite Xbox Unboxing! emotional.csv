"My eldest son, ( now 29), when he was in high school, went to a Halo party where they played Halo all night. At the end of a match, he fired his laser thingie at one enemy, it went through him and also got the other two that were in a jeep crossing the hill at the exact same time. Triple Kill.

As someone who has played halo since it launched but switched to PC. I'm so upset I didn't jump on this. Especially knowing it's a 20th anniversary. I've had all the other halo edition Xboxs. Like the halo 3 and 4 edition xbox 360 and the halo 5 edition xbox one. I'm pretty sure there was a halo edition regular xbox as well. The clear green one maybe ? Besides this one the halo 4 xbox 360 was cool looking but this one is the 20th anniversary.  Damn I'm old and jealous though that I didn't think about getting this.
