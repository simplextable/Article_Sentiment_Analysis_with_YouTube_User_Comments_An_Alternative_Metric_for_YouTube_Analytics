"Hi, I need advice on choosing a new Apple watch series 7. I have never had an Apple watch before, so I'm very hesitant about which size to choose. I originally wanted to buy a larger 45mm size, but then I was in the Apple Store and when I tried them, the watch was slowly bigger than my wrist. My wrist has a circumference of 145 - 150 mm, it depends on the tightening of the tape and I don't really know what size to take, because it's on the border with a larger size (according to the data on the Apple website). I have to say that I would really like the bigger ones, but the smaller ones looked much better on me and fit me much more. So what size should I choose?",Vojtƒõch Herzan,10 ay √∂nce,1

Any I'm lumix shooter with s lineup and i own lumix s5 but i must say sony this does great job with everything it's almost beat s5 but not very sure coz we still have the advantage of 6 12bit hld footage with full frame capacity and best ibis in the world.
