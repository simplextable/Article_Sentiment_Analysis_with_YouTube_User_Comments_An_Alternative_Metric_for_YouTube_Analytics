"Yes, I’m very very upset about the removal of the Touch Bar. I used it all the time. It was one of those things that made Apple stand out. Honestly they could’ve kept it and put in a row of function keys. Or (and this sounds like Apple) if they had to remove it and go back to function keys, don’t make them normal function keys, do something special and make them more useful (the best of both worlds!)",Ben Hegarty,10 ay önce,5
"I like the touch bar, but it always felt doomed because Apple never put one in an iMac or Mac Pro keyboard. Has Apple fully committed to it, software developers would have as well, and they would have made the Touch Bar more fun and productive. Instead, it seems like Apple just wanted to respond to Windows supporting touch screens by having a baby touch screen.",Tom From Alaska,10 ay önce,7

I love the touch bar for its customization and other reasons. I think Apple should sell Macbook Pro models with an optional Touch Bar along with the new keyboard (Function key row and Touch Bar). Apple can possibly add the Touch Bar to the bottom bezel of MBP's screen or add it to the keyboard.,Amer Riaz,10 ay önce,0

People who call themselves “Pros”  pretend to hate the touch bar so they look “smart” and able to memorise millions of shortcuts without the help of the touch bar (despite they had the option to go to the settings and simply turn it to traditional function keys).

However it looks like dark mode isn’t really black because it’s a bit translucent so the notch still screams in my face. ,John Cuccio,10 ay önce,0

If you didnt like the notch could always just go night mode and then you will not see it the same. Be great if a software option could lower the screen down so u didnt have to see the notch. So u could choose. Have more screen or not. Went from 15 inch to 16 inch. To giving more top screen with a notch. Strange design thinking. To make this macbook 100 percent put the touch bar back but above the new physical keys. And lower the screen down to remove seeing the notch. Then its 10/10.

"I was originally upset about the notch, but only because I use my MacBook Pro specifically for video editing and as much is the notch does not bother me at all on my phone I was afraid that whenever I try and view my videos full screen I would have some thing distracting me by cutting out a small portion of my video. Not a dealbreaker at all but some thing that I would get annoyed by. Once I realized that this was the permanent housing for the menu bar, and that it’s not a 16 x 9 aspect ratio I became fine with a notch. Because no matter what, I always produce a Videos in a aspect ratio that is 16 x 9 or wider, so I will always have black bars at the top and bottom when displaying my video anyways. I feel like for some people that notch is an actual disappointment, but probably only in instances like mine where they haven’t stopped to fully think about their use case and realize that it won’t actually hinder them at all",Morgan Productions,10 ay önce,0

Also, the notch really isn't that big of a deal I just don't think it's necessary. Laptops are not a device where you need maximum screen real estate for size of the device, unlike a phone. That's just not a major concern for computer users and is a little bit obnoxious. I hope they give the option to black out that portion of the screen. I wish they would've just made the body bigger and got rid of the notch. Overall, I'm glad Apple is listening to their customers after years of ignoring them.",Kobe Voss,10 ay önce,0

First of all, I'm glad Apple —for a change— favored performance and features over looks and design (Not like 2016 when they made the MBP unnecessarily thin, and therefore unnecessarily expensive and unnecessarily thermally restricted). But, really? You guys think the 2000s looks are good? I mean, they were good for the 2000s, but today? I hated the chunky feet and the round-at-the-bottom/square-at-the-top look; I can't believe Apple went for that. I would've preferred the 2015's look. It was already a slick design, it had more or less the thickness they went for this time and has more or less the port holes they went for this time.",hevad,10 ay önce,0
