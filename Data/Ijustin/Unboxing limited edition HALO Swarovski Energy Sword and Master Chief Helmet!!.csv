"Why I love Justine - she caters for the hard of hearing viewers like myself - I normally have to wait a day or 2 after her uploads for the captions option to show up but they always do, every one of her videos has English captions to help out viewers like myself. Thank you Justine, you're the best!",U A,5 ay önce,0
