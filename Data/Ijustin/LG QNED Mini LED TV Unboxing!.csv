"I was like iJustine since 2006 buying Apple products. Now for the first time I switched to Google Pixel 6 and really feel that magic I use to feel with Apple products. So happy I switched :) Instead of large TV's I find projects are best, they take up a little space and you just need a wall painted eggshell or a pull down screen so much nicer and easier to move around than TV's 60"" and over.",James O'Connor,8 ay √∂nce,2

"Recording studio nerd here... That audio improvement comparison you did at around 3mins was an 'aural exciter' that makes audio sound better when it is super simple and single channel but entirely destroys sound quality when it is more complex. These types of sound effects are so awful that most professional bands on tour in their rider/contract state that no 'exciters' are allowed in the signal path on any channel because when it comes to mixing live sound an exciter will destroy sound quality. In other words TV makers are not to be trusted with sound quality, only fake  sound quality. Get some good recording studio reference speakers and some amps and bypass all audio features on your TV other than Audio out.",Deane TR,8 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),17

"I used to have ¬£600 LG LCD 2010 TV, upgraded to top of the range 2020 LG LED TV. My 2010 one was much slimmer than 2020 TV. The picture quality slightly improved. Saying that I loaded a demo video into my 2010 and it looked the same as on 2020 version. It means that it all depends on broadcast or recording quality. TVs remain the same. It‚Äôs all marketing to persuade sheep to spend more money. What these companies don‚Äôt say is that 5K-8K TVS are bad for your eyes. Justine, would you be so kind to make a video of throwing your old (previously advertised) TVs into rubbish bin. That will be awesomely entertaining. You‚Äôll probably get  many more views.

"I got fed up with my 60"" LG TV when they stopped updates for WebOS only a few years after buying the thing.  I've since bought a Sony, updated my home network to include regular vulnerability scanning of all Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the network, and considering VLANning some of these things to stop potential attacks from devices that could potentially be compromised thanks to fewer/no further firmware updates from their manufacturers.  This TV will look good for a couple of years, but eventually, it'll be a big dumb beast long before it should be.
