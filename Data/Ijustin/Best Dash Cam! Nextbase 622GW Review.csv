"Dashcam story: I have both front and rear mounted dash cams. I was rear ended and the person who hit me told their insurance that they were rear-ended (hit and run) and pushed into me. This was not true, and I had dash cam video to prove it. Without the footage, her insurance wouldn't have accepted full liability, and I would have been on the hook for the $500 deductible in repairs with my insurance company. GET A DASHCAM!",PhotoJoseph,8 ay önce,104
"I have the nextbase 512gw. It's a great unit. Few gripes...the unit can only record in 1080p if you have the rear cam attached. Downgrades from 1440p to 1080p. Having used parking mode for the last 2 years...the units internal battery is shot. It can't be replaced as its soldered on to the motherboard...the unit now only works plugged in. Alot of memory cards including Samsung  and SanDisk aren't compatible. Lastly if you have your car broken into and the camera activates, there is nothing stopping them from just ripping the camera off and bringing it with them. The footage isn't uploaded into cloud storage. It would be great if it had a built in sim board. But otherwise I'm happy with it.",B Fahey,8 ay önce,9

"Great video, helpful and awesome footage!
Also the Rove and RedTiger which are currently 1st and 2nd top selling on Amazon are actually “Quad HD” vs Native 4K, despite being branded as 4K.

"I got a nextbase dash cam a while back, it’s an older model than this but it honestly makes you feel safer having it in your car.

Bought one in November after getting a dent in my rear bumper while it was parked. I opted for the optional rear window camera. It works great.

"Just started looking into getting a dash cam. It would be really nice if there was one that could be installed somewhere hidden and could not be easily removed. It would also be really nice if you could attach 3 or 4 cameras to it, front and rear facing to record in 4k and interior to record in 1080/2k.",Federico Alcala,2 hafta önce,0
"The reason why I did not go with this brand is because when a g-force event occurs, the footage for that is MOVED to a separate location on the SD card than the rest of the footage, whereas with competitors, it is copied so you still have the continuous stream in one location. Also, another reason is the SD card capacity limitation of a pedestrian 128GB whereas much less expensive competitors can handle 512GB.",danwat1234,3 ay önce,5

I feel like having a dashcam is a must in LA. It makes the insurance claim process so much smoother. My gf was in an accident with several witnesses and teslas and nobody stopped to offer their help. The at fault driver who turned left in front of my gf didn’t accept responsibility. We have the viofo dashcam and with the help of the footage it only took two weeks for the two insurance companies to settle the claim.,Mirtill Hagymási,8 ay önce,6

"I have this dash cam also. It's a great dash cam but I'd recommend getting the official Nextbase SD card, or do some research on choosing the right one. If you cheap out on the SD card you'll find the unit crashes all the time because of the huge amount of data it's constantly writing AND deleting (not just writing) which is not a typical usage case for SD cards in a regular camera.",Dominic Pettifer,8 ay önce,6

I've done some special edition videos when traveling, like Hawaii, South Carolina, California, Wyoming, etc. I'm surprised that your recommendation is in a relatively good price range too. Personally I run a $50 G1W but it's actually kind of junk and I've been meaning to upgrade it.

A lot of gig app workers like the Vantrue N2 Pro also.  Vantrue makes a decent cam but I'm always looking for something better because you can't get the footage from an app connected to your phone.  You have to take the card out or hook the dashcam to your computer.  That's really the only downside to my dashcam.  I may try the Nextbase out.",BamaGuyRTR,8 ay önce,2
"I got one of these because of your review. But one thing that absolutely doesn’t make sense to me, is the parking mode. When you close the doors or the car , or open the doors of the car, the camera goes into parking mode and locks the footage. I KNOW they knew this would happen so I’m not sure as to why they wouldn’t do something about it. The app also doesn’t alert you when you capture parking mode footage, you sort of have to just . . . Sort through the hundreds of door open and closing clips. Which will fill your memory card over time because the files won’t overwrite because they are locked! Also , if someone breaks into your car, they can simply take the entire dash cam, that’s with any dash cam however, I just heard you state that as I was typing my comment. I also sort of which there was some sort of locking mechanism over the SD card because a cop can simply take that out as well and everything’s useless.",Kenny Robman,6 ay önce,3

"Great review but you do your research you know to stay clear away from this dashcam, too many complaints of silently freezing up. That's not good while your car is being broken into or you are in a fender bender way to fail at the exact situation that you need it to work. Plus you never listen to YouTube reviewers they are just advertising.",Riczon,8 ay önce,0
"Dashcam story: I have both front and rear mounted dash cams. I was rear ended and the person who hit me told their insurance that they were rear-ended (hit and run) and pushed into me. This was not true, and I had dash cam video to prove it. Without the footage, her insurance wouldn't have accepted full liability, and I would have been on the hook for the $500 deductible in repairs with my insurance company.

DISCLAIMER.. I run this in my car but I'm switching to blackvue because the G22 GW has a horrible overheating problem. It will straight up freeze and I'll have to unplug it until it dies from the battery power and plug it back in. Sometimes I even get a black screen. Also sometimes the cabin camera decides not to even work so I have to unplug it and plug it back in. I'm going to sell it. Anyone interested?,Creator Hut,7 ay önce (düzenlendi),0

IJustine  why do you choose to ignore the ethics of apple products. I want to hear your views on the issue. They are currently exploiting people across sees and that’s not okay. I understand you like apple products and I’m not asking you to stop. But as an influencer you should let your viewers know the whole picture of these products. You are a wonderful person and I just wanted you to know what you are promoting.,Jesus,8 ay önce,0

You are always smiling and it’s heart breaking to see you not smiling when you were checking out the broken in car 🫣   And I hate dash cams that record you driving. So stupid. Why have they feature??
