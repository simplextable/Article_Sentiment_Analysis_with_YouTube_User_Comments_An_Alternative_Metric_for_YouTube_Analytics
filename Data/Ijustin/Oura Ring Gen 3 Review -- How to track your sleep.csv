"I own the Oura ring gen 2 and love it. To those who are thinking about purchasing the gen 3 ring here is something to think about. The only down side is that Oura's gen 3 ring is that it has a new subscription plan. If you add the price of the ring and the subscription for about 3 years, you are better off getting the recent Apple watch and still save money. Those are just my thoughts.",Joshua Baker,9 ay önce,308
"The ring itself seems pretty great but there is no way I'm gonna spend this much money on a product that then forces me to also get a (very expensive) membership so I can actually get all the stats and data. That's as if one would have to pay for the health apps (blood oxygen monitor, EKG etc) on the Apple Watch on top of buying the watch. No way.",Trish204,9 ay önce (düzenlendi),87
"I'm sold. And I mean that literally! As a recent cancer survivor who's more concerned with his health than ever, this looks downright amazing. It is a commitment with that subscription plan (bummer, but I understand it from a business perspective and still decided to take the plunge because of how useful I think this would be to me) so how ironic it's a ring lol.",DanRyb,9 ay önce,48
"I love all of your videos, but this one was really something special.  I love my Oura ring and I just upgraded to the Gen 3 and gifted my Gen 2 to my pilates instructor who loves it.  I am so glad that you did this to show everyone how much great information your ring can provide.  I am a jewelry designer and I wear it next to my other special rings.  I would love to help them design one that maybe has a few diamonds on it for those who need a little extra bling.  The original Oura ring did have one that had diamonds in the $900 ish range and that went away since.  Maybe you can put me in touch with the owner and I could talk to him about designing one with a few stones for added glam.  Thanks for all you do.  I have been following you since the early Apple days and like you I used to go to Apple store openings for the fun and excitement of it all.  Tech rules and so do you!",Karen Bleifer,7 ay önce,1
"I really think the ring approach makes more sense than a watch. The watch is really a fitness monitor or that is what it is really good at, something the phone (which you carry everywhere) can't do.

If Apple or Samsung released a ring focused on sleep, health and tracking, that would've been perfect",Rudra,8 ay önce,13
"Thank you for the very informative video, Justine! I've had sleep issues since early 2013, before I gained all the weight I've gained (which probably hasn't helped). Depression makes me feel even more tired, so that just confuses things. I used to use a Resmed S+ and track my sleep, but I can't remember why I stopped. ",Jordan Bergstrom,9 ay önce,0

I always use my fitbit for sleep and they have an SpO2 sensor which it looks like Oura doesn't have or isn't working until 2022.

Ughh i saw this video and I wanted and Oura ring so bad. I thought this was something that I would actually use and be better for my health. Then I did more research turns out if you are a new customer you have to pay 6.99 for just the basic functions with NO new features!! If you don’t pay the 6.99 you only see the front page and you aren’t allowed to see how your sleep was or heart rate (which is the what the ring is supposed to be for). In the end you end up spending way more money than just for the ring. I was so excited to get this product but now I will be looking somewhere else ,Bella Garcia,9 ay önce (düzenlendi),0

"Do you really need to spend $300 on a  device to learn that you should go to bed early, at consistent time, avoid caffeine and food late night, don't exercise, play video game, use cell phone right before you go to bed to get good sleep? Oops, my mistake.  This ring doesn't tell you that. It just tells you got poor sleep score.  You had to figure out why poor score yourself.  A free article on sleep hygiene could have told you what to do to sleep better for majority of ppl.  If you are the kind of person who has the will to change your sleep habit you probably not the kind of person who need this kind of device in the first place.  I think it all comes down to what the novelty of the device is worth to you.  For me, those info worth maybe $20 and I probably won't even wear it after few weeks because probably won't tell me anything else new.  We are creatures of habit.",David Lee,8 ay önce,0

Lol u see the comments of 1 person trying to get people to whats App them ? A false account pretending to be Justine to make people think to what's app her.    Apple sheep made a video about those fake accounts.  They are not able to be blocked by the uploading person.  In this case the real justine. Watch out and don't let that account fool u.,D.M.J. v.
