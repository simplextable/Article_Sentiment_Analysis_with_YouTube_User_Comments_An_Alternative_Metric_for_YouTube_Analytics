"Wow! What a cool gadget! A portable power station! Fantastic! Oh nice you’ve recorded (in an outside broadcast format) a same brain podcast episode using the power station in a nice picturesque location, by a beautiful lake in a wonderful forest! That’s amazing! I’m loving your tech reviews content Justine! I can’t wait to see what you’re going to review next! ",Edward Hulse,9 ay önce (düzenlendi),0
Nice! I would absolutely love having one of these powerhouses!,gυяυвυlυ •,9 ay önce,3
The panel being 1/5 of the capacity is probably perfect and a set up like this (digital generator) the highest power/watt aspect becomes even more apparent dedicating power to lights and mixing board in this example!!,Dillon,9 ay önce (düzenlendi),0

"I think this calls for some extreme outdoor podcasting.  Build a self contained rack so your mixer is mounted and ready to go, mics in a pocket and light panel on a telescoping arm.  Throw it in a boat, back of a truck in death valley, in a dog sled in Alaska...",Bruce Sutherland,8 ay önce,0
