"Justine is a much more compelling and charismatic character -- Apple would probably be a lot better off with someone like her in Tim's spot ultimately.  She would likely be better at the job overall.  The keynotes would be so much less robotic and so much more joyfully chaotic!  She is an incredible intellect, and it really shines through with how she communicates with great passion, and is also mindful to be concise, as well as comprehensive, in conveying the narrative and impact of a tech product.",Richy,10 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),3

"The iPad mini is a great device and unique to Apple (no other manufacturer makes a high end device at this screen size in 2021) but... the 64GB storage option is inadequate on a tablet, a few high definition movies and you've run out of storage so you always have the anxiety unless you go for the 256GB version.

I‚Äôm always leaning towards bigger screen phones and whether I‚Äôm getting this year‚Äôs iteration, Pro Max will always be my top choice and I was 100% sure that I‚Äôm grabbing it until I‚Äôve watched live Apple event streaming.

"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". ",John Pearson,11 ay √∂nce,0
