"Here’s a short story I came up with to accompany this short film for the launch of Justine’s lightsaber brand! I hope you all enjoy it!

“It was a beautiful day on the planet of Kracatun where former Jedi Master Ezarik was in hiding from the tyranny of the ever expanding galactic empire. Suddenly she felt as if a voice was calling out to her, a pulse she hadn’t sensed in a long time… the force. She decided to investigate where the voice was coming from, so she picked up her lightsaber and set off on a long trek across the planet’s surface. As she traversed the harsh terrain of the planet and got closer and closer to the source of the voice, flashbacks to her time fending off the clones after order 66 became more and more prevalent. Was she really ready to be heading back into the life she tried so hard to leave behind? also she couldn’t help but feel like someone or something was watching her from a distance. Eventually she found where the voice had led her to. It was… a lightsaber? Suddenly she felt a presence behind her, she gripped the Saber tightly and turned around only to see her old friend Jedi Master Young who had recently come back from an expedition on Coruscant to practice some more of the Jedi arts with her. They duelled into the evening practicing different forms of combat stances and attuning their solo connections to the force as well. But Young ventured too far from their camp and found himself in a part of the planet consumed by the dark side of the force, and when he emerged, he was not the same as he once was. Meanwhile Master Ezarik was finishing up her training session when suddenly she felt something swing towards her back, she turned around, blocked the attack with her Saber and suddenly she froze in shock as she looked into the eyes of the man who was Jedi Master Young and all she could see was his eyes glowing red and yellow with the power of the dark side. She knew right then and there, this would be a battle for her life. All of a sudden the practice duel had become very real, as the battle raged on into the night, she was blocking attacks left and right, sparks flying from the colliding sabers, hoping to exhaust her opponent but it was no use, Young wasn’t tiring and she knew this battle couldn’t last forever, but just as it seemed all hope was lost, she remembered she had got something to beat him with, that no one else had…” (to be continued in Episode 2!)",Edward Hulse,8 ay önce (düzenlendi),0
