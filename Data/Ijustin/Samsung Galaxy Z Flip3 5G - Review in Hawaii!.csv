My favorite thing about the Galaxy Z Flip is that it makes me excited about technology again! It sparks wonder and nostalgia in all of us and it's a splash in a stagnant market! Love it !,Brandon,11 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),210
The fact that how much more affordable this is compared to the previous models is dare i say flipping awesome‚Ä¶,JoJ LaL,11 ay √∂nce,301

"The coolest feature of the Flip, which not many people talk about, is that it""s a lot less likely that you‚Äôll end up cracking the main screen. Having it fall while closed lowers the probability of the screen cracking by a lot. This phone I would definitely use naked.",S√≥ Victor Mesmo,11 ay √∂nce,105

"I love this phone, but the 2yr old cameras (which are from a mid-range 2019 'A' series phone) are really showing their age.
Understandably a couple of concessions had to be made to bring down the price so much compared to last yr.
Cant wait to see what they bring out next yr!",Omar Faruk,11 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),2

"Totally agree.
I used to my S21Ultra since it came out 9-10month ago, but I also purchased the ZFLIP3.

Cool vlog Justine. I've seen the new flip in person and it is a cool phone. I know that your a iPhone user but would you consider switching to Android because they just innovate and make cool phones that I think that iPhone doesn't do.
