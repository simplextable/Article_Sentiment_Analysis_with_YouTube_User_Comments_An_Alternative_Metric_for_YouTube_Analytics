EXACTLY!!! You don’t need to upgrade your phone every year just because a new phone is released. Nobody is forcing you to.,Soy Sauce,11 ay önce,160
As someone currently still using an iPhone 7 I am very excited to upgrade! I also don’t have much of a choice at this point with how bad my battery is. Trying to decide which phone to go with is the hardest! The only thing I know for sure is it won’t be the pro max because it’s far too big. I have an iPad for a reason.,Marissa Lordahl,11 ay önce,588

"I appreciate the emphasis on not needing to upgrade every year- Apple gets an unfair amount of pressure on them to make a crazy phone every single rear… this is a normal yearly improvement. Keep in mind, the more recent your phone model is, the longer it’s lifespan is… so you really don’t need a new phone for several years nowadays. So who cares if the iPhone is boring for ONE year.  
From a company standpoint, it’s about longevity too. If they give us everything in one phone, nobody will upgrade again. They have to pace themselves",SketchTheParadigm York,11 ay önce,517

The saturation thing has been available on android for about 10 years. I used to have this Sony camera and you could set it to vivid and it would just make the most beautiful pictures with a little bit more color than real life but not too overdone and I just love that camera. And then I figured their next camera would be better and I bought it and you couldn’t do a preset a vivid. It was terrible I hated it so I’m stoked that finally the iPhone has something like this because otherwise often the photos look a little bit drab,Christopher Finn,11 ay önce,0
"Thank you iJustine for responding to those hate statements. Literally almost everyone at my work was like: “Oh, 120hz finally…We’ve had it for years!”

Since the Apple Event ended, the only thing I'm hearing an seeing is how it hasn't even changed from the 12th one, there is still a notch and things like thaat. I don't care about specifically the notch at all! I have now iPhone SE 2020 previously and I'm living with no face ID and witch big frames, so I don't care about that liitle space at all.

"I love your video Justine! I even laughed reacting how you read those negative comments about the notch and those who make meme about no difference between 12 and 13, what most people don’t understand is that most people don’t change their iPhone every year, so I guess this iPhone 13 is for those who plan to upgrade their 2018 or earlier iPhones. About the notch, I still don’t understand why people complain about iPhone notch, which I’m sure these most people are Android users who don’t even use iPhone… for me personally the iPhone notch is how people see “oh, that’s an iPhone”, imagine those Android smartphones manufacturers have almost identical physical body, they lose their identity.. so, Apple only makes it smaller to 20% and it still exists until today in 2021… why not?",yonathan winarto,11 ay önce,16

Avocado toast could be involved later, maybe… but yeah definitely the Max AND the mini(s). I’ve had iPad mini money for a long time. Does Apple not realize how hard that kind of thing can be to hang on to? I even waded thru the mini 5 ‘cos I heard the mini Pro was coming with bigger screen and ",grlRex,11 ay önce,0
