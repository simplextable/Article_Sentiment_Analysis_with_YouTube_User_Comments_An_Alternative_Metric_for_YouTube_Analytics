Im so glad I started watching Justine this year - Sometimes you need a break from the heavily critical analyses and just need that friend to match your hype over new tech ,,10 ay önce,"2,8 B"

"I knew these new M1 MacBooks were powerful, but being able to apply Noise Reduction on Canon 8k RAW footage (which gives even the most powerful computers a hard time)  in DaVinci Resolve and then play back the noise reduced footage smoothly made my jaw drop. That is simply insane, if you work with DaVinci Resolve you'll understand.",Olu KZ,10 ay önce,194

I watched 3 reviewers so far and none of them presented anywhere close to iJustine's video. She doesn't always get the credit she deserves amongst other reviewers. An amazing video and I appreciate the time Justine put into it to show the power of these new amazing MacBooks. Thank you!,Blending With Henry,10 ay önce,68
"I freaked when you said it feels like the old school MacBooks. When i saw the design i instantly knew they were inspired by the old white MacBooks in design and function. Those MacBooks were the best MacBooks in my opinion, for being plastic, they were solid and great machines with plenty of IO and enough power. I just miss the easy swap battery and ram compartments. Those were the days. I have my old MacBook right next to me and i use it as a charging station for my new Apple products.",PJ Broke,10 ay önce,47

I like Justine’s unbox reviews because she uses Final Cut Pro and that is a good barometer of performance testing. The cost of the MBP pays for the days of time you get back being more free and productive.,technole,10 ay önce,47
"Wow, great review! Yours is the only one I’ve seen so far that really did real life testing to show the true capacity. I don’t need the MBPs and I’m probably getting the 13”, but honestly the promotion and miniLED makes the 14” so tempting!",Luisa Elago,10 ay önce,0

"THIS is the video I've been waiting for. As a photographer who does heavy manipulations in PS, and also does image selections with clients in the field, I took a leap on a 16"" M1 Pro (scheduled to arrive tomorrow!) I wanted the bigger screen for editing on the fly, but hoped that since I'm doing image editing, but no video nor 3d graphics, the Max wasn't necessary for me. Of course, the moment I pressed ""purchase,"" I feared I had made the wrong choice. This video makes me feel more confident that I selected the right configuration for me: that even the Pro chip instead of the Max chip will be a dream.",Rachel Linkwald,10 ay önce,24

"Thank you for review the base 14"", it really showed that for probably 50% of people is more than enough, I mean people in general, of course for actual pros, will upgrade to the Max and up to 64Gb, but for most people, even if they buy the M1 Max it; they won't be using all the overhead raw power of that chip, obviously anyone can buy whaterever they want. But I mean, objectively, the 14"" MBP base model is absolutely more than enough for over 50% of people in general. Also it was great to see Mr. Nathan reacting live to the power of M1 Pro!",enJesus_name,10 ay önce (düzenlendi),2

"Ordered the MacBook Pro 14” and I was actually thinking of switching to the 16”. But seeing both of them side by side, I think I choose the right size for me, especially since I will be carrying my MBP everywhere just like my old MBP 13”. Thanks, iJustine!",J Marc,10 ay önce,0

MBP will work so well for pro users for sure. I don’t think I’m a pro user. I probably would go for a lower end MPB for my needs,PotatoMochi,10 ay önce,0

Thanks for such a fun and informative review, shay.",hagar40,10 ay önce,2
"I think the fully maxed out 14 inch MBP is the way to go. I have a maxed out 13 inch 2018 MBP and I love the size, but the graphics suffer at times, I wish the screen was a little bit larger, and I wish it had MagSafe. The 14 inch MBP solves all of those needs, and it's the perfect size (my GF has a 15 inch maxed out 2018 MBP and I love the graphics performance, but it's too big and heavy, especially for traveling). I do wish that they had put a Touch Bar above the function keys, as I like the ability to use the Touch Bar for video scrubbing, predictive text, and custom mapped shortcuts to do things like take a screenshot. I just hate accidentally touching the Touch Bar, and I miss having function keys.",Scott Dunham,10 ay önce,0

"To a first-order approximation, having Resolve open in the background (and Safari and Notes and iTunes) at 13:40 while Final Cut was rendering should only affect RAM consumption not processor usage, so finding them open in the background should not be meaningful.

"Much appreciate to see the maximum max model together with the base model. There is no doubt M1 Max will conquer Justine’s massive workflows but it still be impressed to see how this base or ‘binned’ M1 Pro could also handle some play back work, which make me feel more confident on believing this base model would be the best choice for the most of users who did basic jobs and some creative work on it. Well done!!!",锂信号Signal Li,10 ay önce,0

I just bought the Mac Mini M1 last Fall and when I saw the new MBPs I IMEDIATELY went to the A-store online and got $750 in trade-in value towards the new 14 inch. I did this last week before the reviews moratorium was lifted. So now I'm trolling reviews looking for positive reviews to squelch any buyers remorse that is creeping in. After watching about 3 minutes of your unboxing I was hooked (on your channel). Now I'm triple psyched but bummed I have to wait a month for mine to ship. I'm into the music end of things (as a hobbyist) so I just got the 14 inch with the base CPU and upgraded to 16 gig of ram and 1TB of storage.

But all of these hands on videos celebrating and hyping the undoing of multiple of Apple's baffling failures over the last few years... I can understand some of the shit PC users routinely heap upon us loyal customers lol. Oh well, they got my money anyhow and I do feel the nostalgia for the similar design to my favorite Mac laptop (and 2nd I've ever owned) the 15.4"" PowerBook G4. All in all, I think Apple is on an upward trajectory regarding not pissing us fans/users off any more with questionable design choices..

"I am so glad APPLE inc finally let go of promoting the industrial design version of "" Body dysmorphic disorder "". For the past ten years they have been trying to shove in all the tech in a "" Wow look how skinny my MacBook pro "" is .... and failing in performance where and when it counts. The battery and the fan and computer components need room. Ports are needed in Pro and leisure computer activities and their dimensions set the standards for physical form of a computer. They had to remove the ports for the sake of the "" THINNEST ""  edges ever achieved in a laptop race. I think they had hired a few preteens from Instagram influencers for their head of R&D.

Ok this is crazy. Thanks Justine! I was wanting to get the imac they released few months back but am waiting for the imac pro...but in the past I had always wanted the macbook Pro...when they changed things in 2016 it put me off with the no ports...the touch bar etc. So I was leaning more towards the imac they released this yr...then was like let's wait for the pro...but these! This is what I originally wanted. Im not sure what to do now..it is a huge investment for me.

Hey Guys! Does it make sense to upgrade the RAM on the baseline 16inch MacBook Pro M1 Pro to 32gb to ‘future proof‘ it? I am quite sure that I wouldn’t really ‘need’ the 32gb of RAM and the entry level should be just fine but since I am actually planning to keep this one for at least 7-9 years I do not wanna ever see it significantly getting slower and therefore thought that an RAM upgrade would be well worth it in the long run.
