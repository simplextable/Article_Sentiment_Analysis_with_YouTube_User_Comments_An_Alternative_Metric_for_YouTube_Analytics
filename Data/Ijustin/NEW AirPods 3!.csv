"I just got the pros, apparently the crackling issues have been fixed in the new batches, and let me say oh my goodness are they incredible. I wonder how these stack up against those considering there’s no noise cancellation

I only recently upgraded to AirPods 3…I was nervous about it because the older AirPods would make my ears hurt quickly. I was actually considering over the ear headphones but in the end took a chance and boy am I glad I did! Even though these are larger in the ear they don’t hurt my ears at all! Totally pleased!,Phillip Paree,7 ay önce,54

"I tried spatial audio on the AirPods max and pro and it’s alright I guess. I wish it was a bit more louder on the sound quality but the background sound is cool. There is songs in Apple Music that implement this but it sounds quite bad and I always go back to the normal audio sound. I guess Instrumental orchestral music shows it and it’s very well but other genres like pop, rap and rock sounds terrible with spatial audio. But spatial audio is really good on watching movies.",Cristian Flores,10 ay önce,0
