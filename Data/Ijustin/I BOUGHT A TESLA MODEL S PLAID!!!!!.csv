"Congrats on your purchase, Justine, and welcome to the Tesla's owner family, but it's so hard to believe you were never in a Tesla before until now??? You are suppose to be this Tech Nerdy girl that has her hands on all kinds of gadgets, including EV obviously, and I remembered watching your video for a Ford Mach-E. Anyway, for a MS Plaid, I will be jumping up and down, too. Congrats again and hope you will enjoy your new Tesla. Peace. ️",skchang168,9 ay önce (düzenlendi),0
