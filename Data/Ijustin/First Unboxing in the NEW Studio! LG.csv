"U really didnt have to vaccum ants and spiders, if u r gonna kill at least do it instant. So annoying that people just dont care other livings but as soon as something happens to tham start to talks abou rights and stuff. U had videos that i didnt liked before but firs time i push dislike button, i know it doesnt change anything but it is the only thing i can do. Have a nice celebration with new vaccum cleaner in “your new” but the others “old” studio",Can Levi,9 ay önce,0
