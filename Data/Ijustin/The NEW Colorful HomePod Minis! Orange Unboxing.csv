"I agree the HomePods are good and the Voice plan sounds great for me I have a white and a space grey. But i had had some inconsistencies using it with HomeKit I frequently get the reply from Siri, when asked to open my Meross garage door opener, I get I’m sorry i’m having connection problems make sure your iPhone is on the same network as this HomePod. Yet other times its just “thats done” and all is fine. I am pleased about the new range of colours. I did also find Apple have problems if you try to extend the supply cable. I bought a high quality 4k compatible USB C cable to extend the reach of where the HomePod was plugged in. The device got “moody” refused to work I got a weird glow on the top which I later discovered was its way of complaining about the cable. Perhaps I should have bought a genuine Apple one. I love your lively presentations which cover the details of the Apple devices, they are great when they all work in Homekit and they have improved but some inconsistencies do still creep in.",Anthony Benson,9 ay önce,0
