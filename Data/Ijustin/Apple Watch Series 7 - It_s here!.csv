"I got the starlight (45mm) with the starlight sport band. Fantastic color, actually quite neutral with the “silver-ish” case but it’s neutral and it’s nice. The band is a warmer white but it’s still very neutral.

I upgraded from a black 44mm space gray series 4 (I liked the black but I wanted to try a bright color) and I love it. Big display is nice (I use it for walking GPS), I use the altimeter because I take it camping and that sort of stuff, and overall I love it. Both models I got were GPS (my phone is on me almost 24/7 so cellular wasn’t a necessity) and I’m fine with it.",Robert A,7 ay önce (düzenlendi),15

"I've been a serious, and I DO mean serious android user since the very beginning...and while I believe Samsung makes some great smart watches, I have been absolutely let down by the Galaxy Watch 4. I MUCH prefer the earlier models that ran on their Tizen OS. I have always been envious of how well apple watches just seem to ""work"" well. I finally bit the bullet and got an iPhone 12 and an apple watch 7 and I love it. I STILL prefer android to iOS, but that watch though, it's just wonderful.",Jeff Edwards,7 ay önce,6

I was pretty sure I’d be going for the green one.

And I also love that my other bands fit. Yay yippee because I have so many. I also use the face protection that lets you change your watch color.

I still have the series 4 and still happy with it. I work in a warehouse. Use the watch mostly to set my timer for breaks and lunches. But my question is. They still got sapphire glass?I remember they had two types of glass for the watches. The regular glass that is the same glass as the glass on your phone and then sapphire glass for the more expensive watches. Sapphire had a nicer sheen to it and more scratch resistant.

Not enough to justify the upgrade from series 6 unless you get it for free of course. What I’d like to see ultimately is a much better battery with days of charge and a bigger selection of watch faces that look real. Colour faces are always to garish and look almost cartoony.,bala8oo,10 ay önce,7
