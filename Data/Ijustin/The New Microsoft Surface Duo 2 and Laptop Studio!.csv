The Surface Laptop Studio is similar in design to the leather HP Folio only it's a bit more powerful. The screen flipping forward is a more elegant design than a laptop with a 360 degree hinge. You wont have a keyboard resting on your lap and there is a lot less chance of potentially damaging your keyboard or getting gunk or fuzz on it from your clothes or legs. The intake intake grills look odd but its better than them being on the bottom to be blocked by your legs or clothing.,Rye Bread,11 ay önce,0

"If there's one device that I'm very conflicted with is the redesigned surface duo. Sure they have handled the issues that were there in the first one but it's lost its aesthetic elegance.

"Microsoft has ensured that many of us will NEVER consider the duo again.  The camera bump destroys its aesthetic and its ability to fold a full 360 degrees and probably ensured lots of cases cracking.  Sadly rather than lean into the productivity tool market with a device for business users, they decided to chase cameras to get positive reviews from YouTubers and Content Creators (who are generally obsessed with cameras).",AlphaBasic,11 ay önce (düzenlendi),1

And the bezels are a joke, they kept the ultra thick bezels for what’s clearly a cost-savings move for them. And I think the notifications bar is too corny. Overall, the first one proved to be such a unique design with a minimalistic look that literally stood out next to its competitors. It just needed thinner bezels and better processing power, this is officially worse than the Samsung fold. Very disappointed.",Lulu,11 ay önce,2

"bro I bought the first surface duo and there's already a second one coming out? That's how you know microsoft ain't even trying. There's hardly any good updates on the first one and I don't know why they don't even bother adding accessories. And the only accessory they advertised it with was the surface slim pen and yet it's limited to what it can actually do? Like why advertise the surface duo with the slim pen if you can't use it to its full potential? At least make the buttons programmable to do other stuff like pause videos or something. Kind of disappointed with the lack of effort Microsoft put into the first duo. I will give it credit for actually being a good device for multi-tasking but I honestly wouldn't suggest buying the second duo until you actually notice microsoft ACTUALLY investing on this device to make it worth the price you paid for which is like almost $2000. Microsoft, if you reading this, get your shit together and at least make the slim pen's button more useful like being able to pause videos and whatnot",Daniel Ordonez,10 ay önce,0
