"When a gimbal cannot even do the most basic gimbal move: the low to high shot or high to low shot, you know you're in trouble. This gimbal only has about 20 degrees of tilt either way. So if you only want to film at chest height and film slow subjects whilst keeping it slow yourself, then this is ok. But in every other regard, it's not a good gimbal at all. Don't underestimate how annoying abysmal tilt range can be. ",Matt Bolt,4 ay √∂nce,0
