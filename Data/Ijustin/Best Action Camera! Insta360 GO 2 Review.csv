"Wow! Another trademark iJustine review, this made me consider getting one of these! The fact that it's waterproof but has such great stabilization and so many mount options is awesome ‚Äì I'm still rocking a GoPro4 lol.",Lindsay Daly,11 ay √∂nce,3
"Really great montage of videos and I can't believe they are all captured using the tiny GO2. Several questions popped up in my mind though:
- were all the audio of you speaking came directly from the GO2?
- for the entire trip, how many times did you need to charge the battery or how did you manage it?",Planet Daryl,11 ay √∂nce,26
"That edit was truely amazing, the transitions and cuts were amazingly timed and fluid. I love it!!!",Noah Bean,11 ay √∂nce,3
"Great video! I have the Go2 and use it when painting murals. I haven‚Äôt used it much lately but you have inspired me! Great footage. I especially liked the underwater shots. I imagine, since you have 2 of these you worked between the two when battery life was low.",Gumption,11 ay √∂nce,1
"It's honestly the perfect travel companion. It's so small, lightweight, portable, can last a few hours and provides you with some good shots with its wide angle lens. Definitely worth considering if you enjoy adventures and outdoor exploring! ",ThreeTwentyTech,11 ay √∂nce,11
"This looks like the kind of situation where the creators started out with just a basic mobile camera and just started saying: ""It would be cool if it had this, and this, and this, feature.."" and then they just really, actually, added all those features.
It's rare that you see a product as well designed as this. Usually it's the consumer who says ""It would be cool if it had.."" months later, and then they just forget about it because they know it's never going to happen.",FirstName LastName,11 ay √∂nce,26

"I don't even need this camera- because I don't vlog but I would still want one. It kinda makes me want to start creating! The possibilites are kinda endless, just because it's so small and easy to capture stuff- I feel like you could film while you do so many thinks that otherwise wouldn't be as easy to do if you had a big camera. And the quality is surprisingly great!",Kasper Stenbom,11 ay √∂nce,18
"Great camera, but I hope they will release a minor upgrade version with larger internal memory.
IMHO, 32GB (28GB usable) is a little too small for 80Mbps video. A 64GB /128 GB version will be great.",„Ç≠„É•„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éª„Éó„É©„Çπ,11 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),11

"Since I didn't hear it or see it: ND stands for ""neutral density"" filters.  The idea being that you want a filter that is ""grey"" in that it blocks the same amount of all colors of light.  Think of like a theater ""red"" filter.  That blocks everything that isn't red, so you get red light.  (Imagine other colors here).  
This is designed so that a super super bright light (like the sun, or the moon maybe?) is 1000 or 10000 or 1000000 times fainter than it usually would be, so then your camera can take a picture and see sunspots, or moon craters, or like, Jenna on a beach, under the noon-day Hawaii sun.",asdfasdf1331,11 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),0

That said, after watching this, and i dont normally comment on peoples appearances because everyone has their own look or whatever. I've noticed over the years that your look is pretty consistent, but you need to know... Your style for travel and hiking is wayyyy more attractive than your typical video appearance. You can take that as a slight toward your normal look or a compliment to what you probably considered ""dressing down"".
