"I graduated from high school in 2018. My sophomore year in high school I made a decision that would completely change my life. I decided to go to a vocational school that my school had the option to go to. I went for welding. Turns out I have a passion for welding. There's just something about laying down a good weld just brings me so much joy. I'm good at my job and what I do. I love my job and my company and my supervisor. I'm so happy that things are finally turning around for me. I've been through a lot in my life. A lot of job hopping bc of a choice that I made a few years ago. If your reading this comment. If you happen to be in a relationship with someone who's manipulative, abusive in any way, forceful with everything, or just in anyway shape or form if your gut is telling you to leave. Take my advice and leave. If they are trying to make you quit your job that you love. Leave. Trust me if I could go back in time, I would've listened to my gut. Life will through you many challenges but you have to know and that you can get through it and you will. I guarantee that you will mke it through. If you ever feel lonely or you feel afraid, look up bible verses or positive quotes. You will make it. You are strong enough, you are beautiful/handsome. You are enough, you are loved.",Mariah Wyant,10 ay √∂nce,128
"Hannah, I am probably one of your most unlikely followers. I am not only old enough to be your mother, I'm old enough to be your grandmother. But you are an influencer to me. What you do for a living was not imaginable when I was your age. There was no internet, no personal computers, no cell phones. We had libraries, typewriters and landlines. But we had the same issues as you do now. Anyone with an iota of humility will always have imposter syndrome. And who isn't tempted to waste the day away on social media or binging on some stupid show? You're doing just fine and you're adorable. Please keep making your content for your peers and us old farts too.",Jeri M,10 ay √∂nce,117

"I also graduated last year with literally no plan in mind. I decided to move back to my motherland that I haven't lived in for an extended amount of time since the age of 11. Those were the best months of my life to date. When I went back, I decided to apply for a masters degree next school year. And while waiting for my admission to come through. I randomly thought well why not just work while I wait. So now I'm working at one of the best hospitals in the Netherlands waiting to be admitted at one of the best universities in the Netherlands while all of this was not planned at all last year.

"I wanted to thank you Hannah, last year I was a nursing student, then I saw your videos and I learned about ""Marketing,"" I had never heard about Marketing as a major - in general I didn't know much about the business field options, mostly because I was in Healthcare. However, I saw your videos, and it really made me interested in Marketing (also other factors), so I switched my major. I will not lie, ot has been quite stressful, because ""bussiness"" is a complete new world, and I didn't had much knowledge about it. Recently I have felt like I should have done all these things already, and that I need to do this amount of things more, and then one advisor telling me to consider Accounting or HR... I don't know, it has been overwhelming and quite sad. You were so right about the ""unsolicited advice."" I don't have a channel like you, or social media presence as a creator, we come from different backgrounds and I probably don't have as much experience or knowledge as my advisors might want me to have, but I have certain goals, they might not be set on stone or have the most clear step by step layout, but I am simply trying my best ! Thank you for this video, for the advice of not having everything figure out, and that that is okay - for the advice of not comparing yourself to others, and that everyone is just trying their best too.

"WOW. Not even through and I can honestly say, you nailed it. About passing grades vs learning. I‚Äôm 30 yrs older than you and to this day, I regret nothing about leaving college to pursue my sport, which lead to my  job and career. I was in an arts program and just found it a waste of money. Teaching me about ‚Äòcreative writing‚Äô when I wanted to be IN the world living life to be able to write about that vs being taught to write. I was about 20 or 21, and it was some of the hardest work I‚Äôve ever done, but the most rewarding and it expanded from there. Then, I went about becoming a certified coach, which was a process.

"I really hope you respond to this comment . I clicked on this video after watching your video made in 2020 about majoring in marketing & before I talk about anything else I just want to let you know that I really wish you the absolute best in life & hope you succeed in anything you set your mind on because based off of the two videos I watched I can tell you are a very driven person and I love how passionate you sound when speaking about your career & life. I really admire you. I clicked on your marketing video because I graduated in 2021 and went to CSU to major in business. I have always had an interest in business & was an undeclared business major because I as well had to take and pass general classes before declaring the college of Business. three months into my freshmen year I had to drop out due to a very traumatic family emergency. This traumatic event was going on during the three months I was in college & it really affected my performance in my classes. After I had dropped out late October I had lost hope in what I was going to do with my future & spent 10 months stressing about my future & trying to find other passions of mine. I even thought about going into real estate, but when I thought about myself being a real estate agent with no experience and just a high school diploma .... it didn't spark an interest in me. I am going to start at a community college in the spring because I also love to learn & school is really all I know. I am interested in majoring in marketing because I love the fact that I get to learn about psychology and what consumers really want. I have been doing more research on marketing & almost everything I read or listen to talks about how its a low salary, their isn't a guaranteed job after graduation, how if you want to make money in marketing you have to go to grad school, and just so many more negative things, but I don't see myself doing anything else other than studying entrepreneurship .. which is also not guaranteed to make you much money. after school  I am also interested in marketing with social media, but ive heard that most marketing classes are outdated when it comes to that. I don't know what to do. i don't want to waste money on college for no reason. I stress a lot because I also absolutely suck at math, but again I am only interested in business. while I was in CSU i was enrolled in a study hall for microeconomics and it was nothing how I thought it would be. It also has to do with math and I am scared that if I take it again this time around I won't do well due to the math aspect of it. I always hear mixed reviews & don't know what to do. I don't want a job that I will hate, but I also want to make a good income. I still haven't finished this video because I got excited to comment, but I really want to know more about what classes you took, if you found them difficult for a person like myself, what job did you land after graduation, do you enjoy it ?, and just any feedback you could give me is much appreciated. I am desperate for help. <3",Angie Arena,8 ay √∂nce,0
"Love the advice in this video and was so so needed!! I still have a little bit of time before graduating college but I'm terrified about anything past that (I feel the whole 'school gives me structure' so much) and this made me feel a little better about it, thank youu <33",April R,10 ay √∂nce,1
