"Man i love japan. Its culture, its people, its transport. The reason Jaoan is my favourite country ( besides Malaysia, where I live and Singapore, which is tied with Japan) is because once at that mall outside Tokyo Disneyland,  in early December 2018, my parents brought us to have Shabu-shabu, and there was a line of three families including us. The first family went in since a table was vacant. Them when another table became vacant the second family let me and my parents go first, and it seemed like it was a long wait, so i respect them a lot",Joshua Lau,11 ay önce,1

"Hurray! A new Sunrise Express episode! These are my favorite videos on your channel. I want to give you a feedback from my country: Compared to the prizes in Germany, the JR Sunrise express ticket is quite economical, especially considering the travel distance and the fact it is a night train with single sleeping compartment. For this price, you can buy a 1st class ICE ticket (InterCity Express train) from Munich to Hamburg, which is about 765km and 9 to 10 hours of traveling time. You can buy food on board, but it is quite expensive. For the money you spent on food you will get a coffee in the ICE Bistro. It is better to bring own food like you did. So, now I want to see the new episode of Travel Alone on the Sunrise Express! Haha! Best regards from Germany",FatCatGotHot,11 ay önce (düzenlendi),0

"Смотрю, любуюсь и наслаждаюсь. Почему в России, с её протяженностью нет такого комфорта в поездах. Стоимость плацкарта в РФ равна стоимости билета на самолёт. Но при этом люди в ту же Анапу едут по трое суток, не говоря уже о поездке из Москвы в сторону Китая. Сейчас хотя бы кондиционеры работают, а то и этого не было - жара, духота, вонючие ноги соседей по плацкарту. Сейчас ходит один спецсостав, в котором даже есть душ, но один на несколько вагонов. Стоимость помыться = 150₽. В этом спецсоставе наконец-то нормально можно помыть и высушить руки в туалете. И на каждой стойке между плацкартами есть доступ в горячей и холодной воде. Но всё равно да такого комфорта, как в Японии на каких-то смешных 12ть часов ",Cvetik Korzhenko,8 ay önce,0
