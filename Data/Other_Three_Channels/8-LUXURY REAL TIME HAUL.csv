"I think the sunglasses look great on you. I love that look of the “old movie” glamorous star in her convertible, sporting a headscarf and sunglasses! The Hollywood glamour from waaay back in the day, before our time, were so chic, sophisticated and styled brilliantly! If only Edith Head could create and style our wardrobes for us! I think the sunglasses definitely have a fifties/sixties vibe that can be considered timeless! ",EEN63,9 ay önce,25

"Lydia watch Breakfast at Tiffany’s with Audrey Hepburn and you will know why these sunglasses are so iconic. Actually they don’t come anymore timeless then this shape. Audrey Hepburn’s style was cultivated by her favorite designer of the time, Givenchy himself. Not only was she his muse, she was a major influence on the fashion world as whole. Jackie Onassis’ style was to some degree influenced by her. Hepburn was the epitome of flawless style darling. She made many pieces and looks world famous. Every influencer worth her salt should know this iconic woman. IMO",G G,9 ay önce (düzenlendi),6

"I have the same issue with mascara transfer so what I do to combat it is wear a pale or skin tone powder eyeshadow under my brows. I don't know if that would work for you but it works great for me. 

Also, I know it might be over stepping but I wondered if I might say something and hope you don't take offense.  But please, please do not pull down on your face when you apply anything. Always  go up. Use an upward motion from your clavicle up to your jawline then from the jawline up to your temple. From your nose bridge out toward your ears and from your center forhead out to your temple. I know you don't like touching your neck but when you spray it, don't forget the back of your neck. It is important. I'm almost 60 and once upon a time I was young and beautiful,  too. And while I know things have changed, getting wrinkles has not.

"It's taken me all day to watch your video...on pause because I've been so busy.... I love it when I can come home and refinish your or Josies videos

Sunglasses, I'm ok with those ones, but Hmmm.... they have to fit your eyebrows, kinds weird to say, but since you asked they are just OK.  In this case they look better on Ali but they are too wide on the side for him. I can never buy glasses of any sorts unless I try them on first. That's just me.",Snoopy,9 ay önce,0
