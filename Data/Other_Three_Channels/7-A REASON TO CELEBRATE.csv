"***Dear dear Lydia I‚Äôm oozing the countryside grandma thingy, didn‚Äôt even now I was. I am a real grandma and only discovered YouTube videos  during the 1st lock down!  I have really been on a journey with it. I have been a single parent living in a city; my kids are grown now. I went through right to buy to buy my council house ( what a big day that was for me).  I get so much inspiration from you and I don‚Äôt have a big house in the country and I don‚Äôt have your budget but I still turn my self out beautifully every day ( well maybe not Sundays my walking day). My house is lovely and perfect for me (especially now my kids have flown the nest). I‚Äôve embraced my lovely grey pixie cut and I‚Äôve stared to wear clothes I thought were too good or nice for work and have been just stuck in my wardrobe waiting for that perfect night/day out. I realise every day is perfect now. So I make myself look absolutely lovely every single day. I get the best comments. One of our new starters at work said I‚Äôm the best dress women she has ever seen, I‚Äôm 30 years older than her!  My tiny garden (yard) is currently full of potatoes,peas, tomatoes, raspberries, lettuce, strawberries, rhubarb, chives and some herbs. My clothes I buy from H&M, Arket, oasis, cos and other high street so it can be done on a smaller budget Lydia you are right I‚Äôm living proof of it. Thanks so much for the inspiration, now of of the visit a reclamation yard, my new hobby.  Xxx",5713 JC,9 ay √∂nce,245
"I think one reason why people get frustrated about you promoting this life-style is not so much money (event though they make it about it) but time. It also comes from your content creating job : we see you making hour-long walks with your dogs , playing dress-up, gardening and cooking... All of this things can be really therapeutic but you need to have time for them every day. You talk about journeys and you have obviously grown from a place where you had no team or almost, had to work countless hours to build a situation where you can afford to take that time, and big bonus it contributes to your job. But would you have imagined this life-style when you where drowned under work every single day, wondering if you were going to make it as a content creator ? Wouldn't you have been frustrated if someone had come and told you that you just had to shift your state of mind when you were at your lowest ? ",Lise Dubois,9 ay √∂nce,88

"I really felt uplifted and in total agreement with your long conversation towards the end of the video about country living and money/mindset. I live in a rented flat. I'm not sure when I'll be able to buy a home or live the kind of lifestyle you live. I aspire to it and on the way, I'm loving my life and making it as beautiful and romantic as I can.

But there‚Äôs so much to be grateful for, I live in Yorkshire surrounded by countryside, once a week I meet my friend to go for a long hike- we have found some of the most incredible places! All free. I‚Äôm growing seeds in my garden a million times smaller than yours- I don‚Äôt have beds but I have plenty of pots ",B M,9 ay √∂nce,62
"Personally I'm inspired by you, your style and your outlook on life. I live in an urban area surrounded by other houses but I flounce around in pretty dresses because you inspired me to embrace my feminine side. I take care of my garden and grow things because I find it relaxing. Even when I had a flat I had plants on my balcony and indoor plants. Now I live in a house and my children are older, I've got myself a puppy because I always wanted one and I see how much joy animals can bring. I can't justify buying hermes bags but I'll sure as hell find dupes for your luxury items so I can wear the looks I like. These things are very much in our heads, comparison is the thief of joy. One person's success does not represent the absence of your own. Meet yourself where you are and work from there. As women we should applaud each other because we go through way too much to not support each other. Never apologise for living your life and being happy.",Shar G,9 ay √∂nce,29
I have always loved your videos and I am an 67 year old want to be English girl.  I love so much watching your life and wishing that I could have lived in England.  Your videos give me the beautiful feeling of actually living my life like that.  I order floral print chairs when florals aren't in here in America.  I have  antique and old world stye furniture in my home.  I have two cow water troughs that are my kitchen garden.  I watch you and Josie and you can not imagine the joy that your videos give me.  I also have a Welsh terrier and a schnauzer.  Don't let the downer people of the world get you down.  I can't afford the clothes you wear but that doesn't stop me from dreaming about them and appreciating how beautiful they are on you.

Now I‚Äôm not saying you should change anything about your content. That‚Äôs your brand and you‚Äôve always been very clear about it.

"Just the other day I was talking to my mother about you, your life and journey, and how wonderful it is to tag along how we all change and grow throughout the years. It at times helps me to get perspective in my own life to see the changes and growth I've done myself. We sometimes don't realise our own journey as we are too busy living, but following you through the years and see the changes in your life gives me possibilities to reflect on my own life as well. It's like a little extra bonus that comes with following you. My mother grew up in the countryside in our homeland and here in Sweden we always lived next to the woods, so living ""in"" nature has been a constant in my life. I now live right next to a forest as a grown-up. As refugees we didn't have much but we got to experience the richness of nature and all her gifts. Even now on clear nights I still fill up in wonder as I look up at the stars.

It‚Äôs a very sad existence. It breaks my heart for their personal misery.

It‚Äôs not just about monetary value like you say but people will project their limiting beliefs into you. I‚Äôm actually working through a lot of limiting beliefs myself surrounding wealth and learning that all of the things that trigger you actually are something that is an unmet desire within you that you have decided to say is not possible for you but by doing so you separate yourself from ever taking action towards the thing you want.

Love your philosophical chat at the end! I totally agree. I think the reason some people are triggered is lack of self worth.

And sometimes that perception can really hold us back. Sometimes it's our amygdala protecting us, even if it's not a true threat. Sometimes we have had horrible and negative experiences which cause us to make up stories or make assumptions about how something is going to go.

People who feel they need to take the time to write a negative comment or play victim are usually those who harbor jealousy for what you have, but don‚Äôt even come minutely close to working as hard as you do to achieve this goal. Mindset is so very important & so very powerful! All WE can do is pray for people who are hurting or feel defeated & keep on being the light. Keep shining!

I don't struggle financially nowadays, I have an stable job, etc but I am still very very aware of the money I am spending, because I know what it feels like to not have it so no, I don't think ""a good mindset"" is everything, I don't think ""a good mindset"" would have helped my mother's bank account.

"I really appreciate your discussion about basically a positive or negative outlook. After I first started watching your channel, I shared your thinking around luxury (not being based on money) with a friend who tends towards negativity, because it spoke to me so much, and really stated so well how I think about life. She responded exactly how you are sharing. I also wonder why?? Why can't she see the ""luxury"" of her own life, or her ability to create luxury out of the things she loves. I see your genuine enjoyment of all things, not just expensive items. And, you are truly genuine in your awe of expensive things (I LOVE your ""oh wow""s all of the time, and especially during your tour of your London hotel room!!), and not a blase kind of response. But your ""oh wow""s for seeing your seeds sprout are just as excited as they are for expensive things. Your morning walks, and excitement for the beauty of the nature around you, the sunrise, all are so genuine, and show a zest for life, and an appreciation of all life offers. I agree; I feel sorry for people who can't seem to find that joy, and who seem to just want to be our killjoys. It does work for them occasionally;  it would feel like a gut punch to me, like it did to you, until I also realized it's from their unhappiness and jealousy. It still stings occasionally. But, I have learned to realize how much happier I am getting equally excited about the smell of freshly cut grass, a beautiful cloud formation, and the amazing piece of jewelry I just purchased.  I'm happy to hear that you are in a healthy place to respond, and I appreciate that you are also genuinely concerned about their unhappiness.",Margo Sickele,9 ay √∂nce,0

"Dear Lydia,  essentially what I gather is that not everyone needs and should be  in the reality you find yourself in. and that is totally fine. Only people who really want will achieve it. The others are just saying without knowing if they actually need this experience. Like 'if I had your money, I would definitely live the same way as you', but how do you know? because what you create is unique, just like anyone else's life. Pulling other people's experience into your life is not healthy.

I love this video Lydia. I wanted to say that tiktok has very different people watching you than the people who watch your YouTube videos. Ultimately you are a beautiful woman and regardless of what you say or do other women will tear you down because they are jealous. It's funny because I watched your videos a whole back thinking there is no way I can look as good as she does and felt really down in the dumps as I was comparing myself in a negative way. Swiftly after thst I thought to myself.... do you walk every morning? Do you exercise near enough everyday? Do you ensure to eat healthy regularly? The answer to the above at the time was no. So how can I expect anything good to come out of moaning in my head about why can't I be like xyz... its interesting and I have now begun to implement more of a structure to my exercise and eating and feel much better for it. Its the same with your work. You work really hard and I doubt many people would be able to put in and do as much as you. They are thinking from a victim mindset and unfortunately until they are willing to grow their mindset it will be the same and they will continue to share their opinion in an unhelpful way.

"I think that life is a mix of things. I think you are absolutely right when you say that our mind has the power to make our life look a certain way or another. However, there are other things at play, in my opinion. Money is certainly one of them. Even if you are in a great mind space and see everything in a positive light, if you keep getting slapped by problems that become really big but could easily be solved with money, and you do not have it, then yes, money is the answer. Does it make up for everything? No. However, money buys you serenity, which makes the whole process easier. With ""money"" I mean enough to feel safe when things happen, and not having to cry at night if you happen to have to go to the dentist. ",Loytoco,9 ay √∂nce,18

"Totally understand where you are coming from in regards to the TikTok and limiting yourself in your mind, but I am also ‚Äòpoor‚Äô I can completely understand how people feel wealthy people brag and are out of touch. It‚Äôs very hard for poor people and disadvantaged people to feel that they can achieve what you have. There are poor people living with mental health issues, disabilities, unstable family homes etc and the world we live in it‚Äôs very difficult for people. Not saying nasty comments are good or that it is good to be negative however it‚Äôs good for people such as yourself to be aware of your own privilege and good luck. I think saying it‚Äôs a state of mind can come across as quite offensive to people struggling to cover the cost of living, with no time time even visualise the life they want to live as they don‚Äôt have time and in some cases it‚Äôs just not going to happen for some, they will stay poor and disadvantaged and they will continue to struggle to make ends meet. I enjoy your content and I have no issue with the fact that you are wealthy and talk about things I can‚Äôt afford, I am influenced by your gardening and lifestyle, however please be aware that you live in a very different space to many people, and maybe just be careful what you say, people are really suffering. You don‚Äôt need to feel guilt or explain your situation, just be aware that people are different ",Marissa Sturzaker,9 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),3
I haven‚Äôt been following you  for years  but a few months ago one of  your videos caught my interest.  You are absolutely refreshing and funny.

"Lydia I have been watching you for many years, and I think you are awesome, I love who you are and not what you have.  The sad thing about people is they focus so much on the negative and not the positive. The ones making the comments are ones that the issues with money, if they don‚Äôt like what you say or do, then don‚Äôt watch I could never understand jealousy it is just there own insecurities,  instead of making rude hurtful comments, maybe if they got out and worked harder and had more goals they too could have what they obviously deserve is money. I am in a stage in my life where it seems like everything is falling apart, but if I sit here and cry wow is me then I deserve what is happening. I love watching you I think you are a beautiful person inside and out. I am so happy for people when they succeed in life and are in a happy place. Please people don‚Äôt talk about the past and what you think Lydia did or didn‚Äôt do. The past is over we are in the now.

"Regarding the lifestyle comments.. here's the thing:  everyone evolves in their own time.  It can take a whole lifetime for some people to realize their own relationship with what they want out of life, with what they want from their relationship with money, and what they CHOOSE for their life.  I just retired from 25 years with the state as an IT Analyst at a local university, and pension life is scary!!  But, I've realized that my mindset can set me free... I don't need to buy something everyday (like I did when I was working full time), I don't need to buy something right now - today (like I did when I was working), and there was a huge cost to working outside my home every day.  I am so much happier now, taking care of my home and garden and pursing creativity on the side.  But I'm a broke a** lady now! ;-)  People need to come to terms with their own choices in their own time... most of the 'negativity' that you are getting, are the ripples of frustration from folks who don't know how to live the life they want.  You've come a long way in your confidence journey, and maybe watching your journey will inspire others to help with their journey.  Gardening, in particular can be done anywhere... except at my house, where the deer and rabbits eat everything not covered with cage cloches... lol.   You're making a hugely positive difference in the world, Lydia... keep up the awesome work! ;-)",Lynn Rasmussen,9 ay √∂nce,2

First of all I would like to say that I have been following you for a while and I really like you. ‚ô°You make great videos and have a really nice style. Regarding the 'negative comments' I think that maybe your lifestyle is a little bit offensive at the moment because of the current climate and sustainability issues.

"Whilst I completely understand where you are coming from - especially with TikTok, having been on there for about 2 years now and I appreciate that land is lawless - I think it is important to recognize one's own privilege. Yes, you have worked hard for what you have and, yes, some of these ""Country Grandma"" traits are affordable but it goes deeper than that. You mention your previous home as your less-than; your previous home is what some folk could only dream of. Yes, it was ex-council estate but it wasn't council anymore, you owned that home and it was safe. That is a lot more than what many, many others can say.  You mention that ""people are allowing themselves to be restricted"" but that negates systemic racism, domestic violence, fatphobia, homophobia and poverty... I really could go on. I don't mean to make this all deep & meaningful but this is not a one size fits all conversation where people are all dealt the same hand in life. I really hope this doesn't come across as an attack, I watch your videos regularly, but the woman who is working 3 jobs to feed her kids or the person who is facing work place racism on a daily basis doesn't need to be told she is ""restricting herself"" - they are being let down by a system created against them.",Laura Ghiacy,9 ay √∂nce,61

"I definitely do understand where you are coming from when you say that peoples perceptions that they cannot live a country lifestyle are down to a mindset. I imagine that‚Äôs true for many. I think perhaps it‚Äôs also true that what stops people is the motivation to do so even though they want it. That‚Äôs a very complex subject matter. Motivation is a layer that comes on top of other factors. It would be disingenuous to suggest that everybody has equal chances in life. If you are a woman, a BAME person or other group you have always had to fight harder to attain the same outcome as men in business. The cards you are dealt with earlier on have an effect. Think of these like your personality base layer. If you come from a more positive supportive and intelligent family you get a better emotional skill set from childhood. If you come from a wealthy family you get a better financial set up early on. If you are lucky enough to be born what society perceives as ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù this too will give you extra help in being a winner in life.  I think it‚Äôs obvious how hard that you work to achieve the things you have achieved and that is to be applauded. It is just a note that not everybody has the motivation and the reasons for that can be very complex and not simply about how much effort or energy they are willing to put in.",Affie Panayiotou,9 ay √∂nce,2

You said in your money manifestation ‚Äúrant‚Äù(?) that maybe you‚Äôre missing something so I just want to fill in that gap. Not in a hateful way, just maybe give you that perspective you may be in need of. During a cost of living crisis where people even on good money are feeling the pinch, many on average salaries are struggling to make ends meet and getting into further debt, people are also calling in sick to work because they can‚Äôt afford the fuel to get to work. Many are choosing to go hungry so their kids can eat. Many were living in poverty even before this, and quite frankly the repercussions of the war in Ukraine and the years of austerity and now this energy crisis‚Ä¶ to put it in a nutshell will either drag people into crippling poverty, if not kill them. That‚Äôs the seriousness of this. And I‚Äôm not being funny maybe you are so far removed from that lifestyle that it‚Äôs just unobtainable but the reality is, even if manifesting money was the way out of this dire situation, it‚Äôs not going to heat homes right now, or put food on tables.

People living pay check to paycheck cannot invest the time to meditate their way out of a situation with therapy for example.

I get the feeling there is SUCH a massive variation of your followers over social platforms, some seem jealous, some admire you etc that there are so many different ways people perceive you. I‚Äôm not rich nor am I poor, but I love watching your YouTube‚Äôs, TikTok‚Äôs & instagram posts.

"I think you need to recognise your privilege. Money has bought you the mindset you have whether you like to admit it or not. All the things you talk about that bring you joy are ultimately all things that money has provided. Money has given you the ability to buy a fancy house surrounded by acres of land, the ability to throw money at decorating your house over and over again to your aesthetic, lavish belongings, travel, ACCESS TO THERAPY, designer doggies, the ability to go on these 5 hour walks because you don‚Äôt have to work 3 jobs to support your family etc the list goes on. You can say money hasn‚Äôt bought you happiness and yes happiness comes from within TO A CERTAIN EXTENT but if you took all of these things away, I‚Äôm sure your happiness would not be to the same. On top of that, your channel focuses on all the things that bring you joy which, as my previous list suggests, requires money.",PM K,9 ay √∂nce,22

"I think on YouTube as in everyday life, to try to understand why other people are hurtful, offensive, rude, angry and just generally seem to spend their time trying to put these negative emotions on other people is fruitless. You can drive yourself mad trying to understand why other people do things and it's just not worth it. Not everyone will like you or the things you say and do, not because they are wrong but because some people seem to find anything/everything offensive and think that they have to comment on everything that they don't agree with.

"We are conscious creators of our own reality and our thoughts + belief systems determine our life experience. Sadly many people are unconsciously blocked by limiting beliefs, traumas and experiences that have literally been programmed into their subconscious mind from childhood and shaped their lives. That unconscious programming can block people from creating the life they desire. Now, it is possible to work on these limiting beliefs to change them - but first you have to be aware of them. I grew up being told that money doesn‚Äôt grow on trees or that wealthy people are unscrupulous which influenced negative ideas about money in my own mind. Once I recognised this I actively sought to change the belief - after all, there are plenty of decent ‚Äúrich‚Äù people in the world doing great things. I was actively working to change my money story + wealth mindset in this way and it worked! ‚Ä¶I feel it‚Äôs important to be mindful and compassionate of those who might not have the consciousness or wherewithal to change their lives whilst striving to be the best you can be as an example of what‚Äôs truly possible!",Katie Hedges,9 ay √∂nce (d√ºzenlendi),1

I'm single, I don't have anybody to drive off to the countryside with, I'm in the suburbs and as lovely as it would be to go on a long walk in the countryside  I'm not gonna go on my own and my friends are all busy. I might plan a day out like that once in a blue moon but it isn't my day-to-day reality.

"I do understand both sides. But I think, people have a valid point that having more monetary resources at your disposal (and well earned and that they worked hard for) creates the accessibility  towards having this lifestyle. Outside is free, but you have invested lots of money into your home, land, garden, flowers, greenhouse, wardrobe, kitchenware, cars, etc. If also have afforded yourself the kind of time in your lifestyle that can go take walks across giant fields, or go on long walks with your dogs and friends. You're job is lifestyle. You are spending lots of money on your channel every video almost on brand new clothes haul, skincare, houseware, kitchen stuff, trips etc  And I benefit from it all obviously as a viewer, but I also know the reality of I have to come to work in a small 4 walled room with no windows or personal decor for a hospital system 8-10 hours a day not working from home at my own speed and set schedule with a team that is regularly working for me and supporting my lifestyle based career, then have to go home, cook dinner for my family with what we can afford to buy from the store, on furniture we saved up for a long time for, in a city that doesn't have free outside space readily available at any time of the day. If my career was creating a beautiful life to enjoy with my family and friends it would be alot easier to afford that life. I love having the escapism of watching your channel everyday and getting a taste of a life that I would love to create but it is not reality for majority of people watching your channel.
