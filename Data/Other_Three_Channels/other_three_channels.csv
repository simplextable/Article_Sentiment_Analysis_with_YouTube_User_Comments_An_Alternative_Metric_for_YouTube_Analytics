I was so delighted when I bagged my dresses to get my heart broken later to say they were actually gone. If it was your first collection I would have understood better however this is your 3rd‚Ä¶4th?

They‚Äôre absolutely hilarious, they get on with dogs well, and their eggs are excellent for baking. Actually all waterfowl eggs are excellent for baking, for whatever reason they lend an extra kind of fluffiness to baking that normal eggs do not. Plus, ducklings bond with whoever they see first upon hatching so if a duckling bonds with you, it will literally follow you everywhere like a little feathered puppy. They also eat garden pests, like slugs and other nasties that might eat your beautiful produce. Just some food for thought. P.S I LOVE the silk sleeveless lemon dress on you.

There was a HORRIFIC evil event that happened in the states where a gunman killed 25 innocent children and some teachers. We all know that they are good people. Last year a dear friend of mine, who was really like an angel, one of the most incredible people you ever could meet was killed in a horrible terrifying accident - she was a really good person. If good things happen to good people, then bad things happen to bad people and...well...I'm sure I don't have to name some horrible well known people who get awards, millions and a seemingly have a great love life.

I moved and still live in a beautiful area, everyone's house is well cared for (albeit for one, and if truth be told I kind of like the resistance to change of the inhabitants) Everyone is at different stages in their lives, I love living here and and the feeling of being part of an every evolving 'landscape'  never makes me feel wedded to a certain aesthetic.

As a designer I had many clients asking me to design their house like ""that movie with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson"". I was obsessed with that house too so knew exactly how to deliver their brief. My friend and I have watched it so many times we joke we could play each of the roles. Not sure if Kelly told you but the deli they go to when they are all shopping for dinner is Ina Garten's original famous deli and where her brand, The Barefoot Contessa, started. If you look back at it you'll see the deli bags hanging on the wall with her brand. Now I'm not going to assume you've watched ""Its Complicated"", another of Nancy's films. Meryl Streep's house and bakery in that are divine too. Watch that if you haven't already. On a trip to America I  actually hunted down the location of that house and drove past and soaked up the absolutely beautiful area it is in. That East Coast style of America you mentioned is very influenced from the English country style simply because its origins are English but now with their history and lifestyle giving it its own spin. Nancy's daughter wrote and directed ""Home Alone"" with Reece Witherspoon. You can see the influence, aesthetic and talent her mother has passed on. That house is a really lovely experience too! Lots to watch, enjoy! Oh and if you haven't watched any of The Barefoot Contessa cooking shows they are fab. I've lost many days escaping into Ina's kitchen.

The Highclere estate is beautiful there are some stunning lakes to walk around (easiest to drive to) and there are also beautiful Coachouses you can stay in. You can drive 5 mins to the village of burghclere where you can see the village hall which is used as the school in the show. I highly recommend The Pheasant country pub in Highclere.

248,"Hello Lydia, I truly love watching your videos but there is one thing you mentioned that caught my attention and I would like to share my thoughts on it. The masseter muscle Botox treatment. I am very delighted to hear that it has worked wonders for you. Headaches are really awful and the fact that you have been able to dramatically reduce your paracetamol use is amazing. However, I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about more natural options: especially as you mentioned that people close to you have decided to go for Botox. It‚Äôs important to remember that we are all different and Botox may not be essential for each individual (invasive).. better to have an assessment first. It could simply be tension of the face/jaw/neck or issues with the joints of these areas which are causing a misalignment in the upper body thereby causing extra tension. As an osteopath myself I would highly recommend anyone with jaw tension to try a more natural route like osteopathy or chiropractic before jumping into Botox. ",Yiashnee Vencat,9 ay √∂nce,4,9,ay,9,1

I get so much inspiration from you and I don‚Äôt have a big house in the country and I don‚Äôt have your budget but I still turn my self out beautifully every day ( well maybe not Sundays my walking day). My house is lovely and perfect for me (especially now my kids have flown the nest). I‚Äôve embraced my lovely grey pixie cut and I‚Äôve stared to wear clothes I thought were too good or nice for work and have been just stuck in my wardrobe waiting for that perfect night/day out. I realise every day is perfect now. So I make myself look absolutely lovely every single day. I get the best comments. One of our new starters at work said I‚Äôm the best dress women she has ever seen, I‚Äôm 30 years older than her!  My tiny garden (yard) is currently full of potatoes,peas, tomatoes, raspberries, lettuce, strawberries, rhubarb, chives and some herbs. My clothes I buy from H&M, Arket, oasis, cos and other high street so it can be done on a smaller budget Lydia you are right I‚Äôm living proof of it.

2,"I think one reason why people get frustrated about you promoting this life-style is not so much money (event though they make it about it) but time.

All of this things can be really therapeutic but you need to have time for them every day. You talk about journeys and you have obviously grown from a place where you had no team or almost, had to work countless hours to build a situation where you can afford to take that time, and big bonus it contributes to your job. But would you have imagined this life-style when you where drowned under work every single day, wondering if you were going to make it as a content creator ?

It at times helps me to get perspective in my own life to see the changes and growth I've done myself. We sometimes don't realise our own journey as we are too busy living, but following you through the years and see the changes in your life gives me possibilities to reflect on my own life as well. It's like a little extra bonus that comes with following you. My mother grew up in the countryside in our homeland and here in Sweden we always lived next to the woods, so living ""in"" nature has been a constant in my life.

It‚Äôs not just about monetary value like you say but people will project their limiting beliefs into you. I‚Äôm actually working through a lot of limiting beliefs myself surrounding wealth and learning that all of the things that trigger you actually are something that is an unmet desire within you that you have decided to say is not possible for you but by doing so you separate yourself from ever taking action towards the thing you want.

After I first started watching your channel, I shared your thinking around luxury (not being based on money) with a friend who tends towards negativity, because it spoke to me so much, and really stated so well how I think about life. She responded exactly how you are sharing. I also wonder why?? Why can't she see the ""luxury"" of her own life, or her ability to create luxury out of the things she loves. I see your genuine enjoyment of all things, not just expensive items. And, you are truly genuine in your awe of expensive things (I LOVE your ""oh wow""s all of the time, and especially during your tour of your London hotel room!!), and not a blase kind of response. But your ""oh wow""s for seeing your seeds sprout are just as excited as they are for expensive things. Your morning walks, and excitement for the beauty of the nature around you, the sunrise, all are so genuine, and show a zest for life, and an appreciation of all life offers. I agree; I feel sorry for people who can't seem to find that joy, and who seem to just want to be our killjoys. It does work for them occasionally;  it would feel like a gut punch to me, like it did to you, until I also realized it's from their unhappiness and jealousy. It still stings occasionally. But, I have learned to realize how much happier I am getting equally excited about the smell of freshly cut grass, a beautiful cloud formation, and the amazing piece of jewelry I just purchased.

Pulling other people's experience into your life is not healthy.

173,I love this video Lydia. I wanted to say that tiktok has very different people watching you than the people who watch your YouTube videos. Ultimately you are a beautiful woman and regardless of what you say or do other women will tear you down because they are jealous. It's funny because I watched your videos a whole back thinking there is no way I can look as good as she does and felt really down in the dumps as I was comparing myself in a negative way. Swiftly after thst I thought to myself.... do you walk every morning? Do you exercise near enough everyday? Do you ensure to eat healthy regularly? The answer to the above at the time was no. So how can I expect anything good to come out of moaning in my head about why can't I be like xyz... its interesting and I have now begun to implement more of a structure to my exercise and eating and feel much better for it. Its the same with your work. You work really hard and I doubt many people would be able to put in and do as much as you.

198,"I think that life is a mix of things. I think you are absolutely right when you say that our mind has the power to make our life look a certain way or another. However, there are other things at play, in my opinion. Money is certainly one of them. Even if you are in a great mind space and see everything in a positive light, if you keep getting slapped by problems that become really big but could easily be solved with money, and you do not have it, then yes, money is the answer. Does it make up for everything? No. However, money buys you serenity, which makes the whole process easier. With ""money"" I mean enough to feel safe when things happen, and not having to cry at night if you happen to have to go to the dentist. ",Loytoco,9 ay √∂nce,18,9,ay,9,1

280,"I think you explained yourself wonderfully, I just think people are so tired of working hard, with very little to show for it, and they lose hope and inspiration.  Years ago people would retire at 60 and have somewhat a decent retirement, now before most people reach 67 retirement age they will have some kind of illness or disability and unable to enjoy themselves and if they have managed to buy their own home it will have to be sold to keep them in a retirement care home, so I think a lot of people have lost hope.

282,"Totally understand where you are coming from in regards to the TikTok and limiting yourself in your mind, but I am also ‚Äòpoor‚Äô I can completely understand how people feel wealthy people brag and are out of touch. It‚Äôs very hard for poor people and disadvantaged people to feel that they can achieve what you have. There are poor people living with mental health issues, disabilities, unstable family homes etc and the world we live in it‚Äôs very difficult for people. Not saying nasty comments are good or that it is good to be negative however it‚Äôs good for people such as yourself to be aware of your own privilege and good luck. I think saying it‚Äôs a state of mind can come across as quite offensive to people struggling to cover the cost of living, with no time time even visualise the life they want to live as they don‚Äôt have time and in some cases it‚Äôs just not going to happen for some, they will stay poor and disadvantaged and they will continue to struggle to make ends meet. I enjoy your content and I have no issue with the fact that you are wealthy and talk about things I can‚Äôt afford, I am influenced by your gardening and lifestyle, however please be aware that you live in a very different space to many people, and maybe just be careful what you say, people are really suffering.

298,"Regarding the lifestyle comments.. here's the thing:  everyone evolves in their own time.  It can take a whole lifetime for some people to realize their own relationship with what they want out of life, with what they want from their relationship with money, and what they CHOOSE for their life.  I just retired from 25 years with the state as an IT Analyst at a local university, and pension life is scary!!  But, I've realized that my mindset can set me free... I don't need to buy something everyday (like I did when I was working full time), I don't need to buy something right now - today (like I did when I was working), and there was a huge cost to working outside my home every day.  I am so much happier now, taking care of my home and garden and pursing creativity on the side.  But I'm a broke a** lady now! ;-)  People need to come to terms with their own choices in their own time... most of the 'negativity' that you are getting, are the ripples of frustration from folks who don't know how to live the life they want.  You've come a long way in your confidence journey, and maybe watching your journey will inspire others to help with their journey.  Gardening, in particular can be done anywhere... except at my house, where the deer and rabbits eat everything not covered with cage cloches... lol.

378,"Whilst I completely understand where you are coming from - especially with TikTok, having been on there for about 2 years now and I appreciate that land is lawless - I think it is important to recognize one's own privilege. Yes, you have worked hard for what you have and, yes, some of these ""Country Grandma"" traits are affordable but it goes deeper than that. You mention your previous home as your less-than; your previous home is what some folk could only dream of. Yes, it was ex-council estate but it wasn't council anymore, you owned that home and it was safe. That is a lot more than what many, many others can say.  You mention that ""people are allowing themselves to be restricted"" but that negates systemic racism, domestic violence, fatphobia, homophobia and poverty... I really could go on. I don't mean to make this all deep & meaningful but this is not a one size fits all conversation where people are all dealt the same hand in life. I really hope this doesn't come across as an attack, I watch your videos regularly, but the woman who is working 3 jobs to feed her kids or the person who is facing work place racism on a daily basis doesn't need to be told she is ""restricting herself"" - they are being let down by a system created against them.",Laura Ghiacy,9 ay √∂nce,61,9,ay,9,1

381,"I definitely do understand where you are coming from when you say that peoples perceptions that they cannot live a country lifestyle are down to a mindset. I imagine that‚Äôs true for many. I think perhaps it‚Äôs also true that what stops people is the motivation to do so even though they want it. That‚Äôs a very complex subject matter. Motivation is a layer that comes on top of other factors. It would be disingenuous to suggest that everybody has equal chances in life. If you are a woman, a BAME person or other group you have always had to fight harder to attain the same outcome as men in business. The cards you are dealt with earlier on have an effect. Think of these like your personality base layer. If you come from a more positive supportive and intelligent family you get a better emotional skill set from childhood. If you come from a wealthy family you get a better financial set up early on. If you are lucky enough to be born what society perceives as ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù this too will give you extra help in being a winner in life.  I think it‚Äôs obvious how hard that you work to achieve the things you have achieved and that is to be applauded. It is just a note that not everybody has the motivation and the reasons for that can be very complex and not simply about how much effort or energy they are willing to put in.",Affie Panayiotou,9 ay √∂nce,2,9,ay,9,1

You're job is lifestyle. You are spending lots of money on your channel every video almost on brand new clothes haul, skincare, houseware, kitchen stuff, trips etc  And I benefit from it all obviously as a viewer, but I also know the reality of I have to come to work in a small 4 walled room with no windows or personal decor for a hospital system 8-10 hours a day not working from home at my own speed and set schedule with a team that is regularly working for me and supporting my lifestyle based career, then have to go home, cook dinner for my family with what we can afford to buy from the store, on furniture we saved up for a long time for, in a city that doesn't have free outside space readily available at any time of the day. If my career was creating a beautiful life to enjoy with my family and friends it would be alot easier to afford that life. I love having the escapism of watching your channel everyday and getting a taste of a life that I would love to create but it is not reality for majority of people watching your channel.

Always  go up. Use an upward motion from your clavicle up to your jawline then from the jawline up to your temple. From your nose bridge out toward your ears and from your center forhead out to your temple. I know you don't like touching your neck but when you spray it, don't forget the back of your neck.

I want to give you a feedback from my country: Compared to the prizes in Germany, the JR Sunrise express ticket is quite economical, especially considering the travel distance and the fact it is a night train with single sleeping compartment. For this price, you can buy a 1st class ICE ticket (InterCity Express train) from Munich to Hamburg, which is about 765km and 9 to 10 hours of traveling time. You can buy food on board, but it is quite expensive. For the money you spent on food you will get a coffee in the ICE Bistro. It is better to bring own food like you did.

Also once I learned about the climate and ethical implications of the fashion industry I‚Äôve shifted to shopping second hand as much as possible and trying to use my clothes as much as possible.

You would would have so many opportunities her and you have the personality to make friends anywhere. Heck, I will come down and get to know you if you‚Äôd like. By car it would take me anywhere from 3 1/2 hours to 4 if I drove but if I flew from Fresno to L.A. It would take about 45 minutes. I could easily see you as a California girl or Hawaii girl. Think about it. If you ever want to talk, whether its on the phone, texting, or email, let me know and I will give you my info. So glad you had a great time!

Most people could be like ""Oh ...well you don't have to be influenced by content creators so easily"" but really content creators are the new 'famous people' or 'influential people'. If you see 100% of content creators going out all the time... you're going to feel like you have to go out all the time or you're doing life wrong. I appreciate vlogs like this.

1,"I graduated from high school in 2018. My sophomore year in high school I made a decision that would completely change my life. I decided to go to a vocational school that my school had the option to go to. I went for welding. Turns out I have a passion for welding. There's just something about laying down a good weld just brings me so much joy. I'm good at my job and what I do. I love my job and my company and my supervisor. I'm so happy that things are finally turning around for me. I've been through a lot in my life. A lot of job hopping bc of a choice that I made a few years ago. If your reading this comment. If you happen to be in a relationship with someone who's manipulative, abusive in any way, forceful with everything, or just in anyway shape or form if your gut is telling you to leave. Take my advice and leave. If they are trying to make you quit your job that you love. Leave. Trust me if I could go back in time, I would've listened to my gut. Life will through you many challenges but you have to know and that you can get through it and you will. I guarantee that you will mke it through. If you ever feel lonely or you feel afraid, look up bible verses or positive quotes. You will make it. You are strong enough, you are beautiful/handsome.

103,"I really hope you respond to this comment . I clicked on this video after watching your video made in 2020 about majoring in marketing & before I talk about anything else I just want to let you know that I really wish you the absolute best in life & hope you succeed in anything you set your mind on because based off of the two videos I watched I can tell you are a very driven person and I love how passionate you sound when speaking about your career & life. I really admire you. I clicked on your marketing video because I graduated in 2021 and went to CSU to major in business. I have always had an interest in business & was an undeclared business major because I as well had to take and pass general classes before declaring the college of Business. three months into my freshmen year I had to drop out due to a very traumatic family emergency. This traumatic event was going on during the three months I was in college & it really affected my performance in my classes. After I had dropped out late October I had lost hope in what I was going to do with my future & spent 10 months stressing about my future & trying to find other passions of mine. I even thought about going into real estate, but when I thought about myself being a real estate agent with no experience and just a high school diploma .... it didn't spark an interest in me. I am going to start at a community college in the spring because I also love to learn & school is really all I know. I am interested in majoring in marketing because I love the fact that I get to learn about psychology and what consumers really want. I have been doing more research on marketing & almost everything I read or listen to talks about how its a low salary, their isn't a guaranteed job after graduation, how if you want to make money in marketing you have to go to grad school, and just so many more negative things, but I don't see myself doing anything else other than studying entrepreneurship .. which is also not guaranteed to make you much money. after school  I am also interested in marketing with social media, but ive heard that most marketing classes are outdated when it comes to that. I don't know what to do. i don't want to waste money on college for no reason. I stress a lot because I also absolutely suck at math, but again I am only interested in business. while I was in CSU i was enrolled in a study hall for microeconomics and it was nothing how I thought it would be. It also has to do with math and I am scared that if I take it again this time around I won't do well due to the math aspect of it. I always hear mixed reviews & don't know what to do. I don't want a job that I will hate, but I also want to make a good income. I still haven't finished this video because I got excited to comment, but I really want to know more about what classes you took, if you found them difficult for a person like myself, what job did you land after graduation, do you enjoy it ?, and just any feedback you could give me is much appreciated. I am desperate for help. <3",Angie Arena,8 ay √∂nce,0,8,ay,8,0
