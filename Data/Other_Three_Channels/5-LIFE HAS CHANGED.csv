Being a well seasoned 66+ senior I do recollect a time in my early thirties when life seemed to change for me as well.

"This has got to be my all-time favorite vlog of yours. You have been so honest and genuine in explaining your life and how much you have grown and changed as a woman, a wife, and a mother to your fur babies. The personal conversation you shared at the end of this blog was so beautiful, heartwarming, heartfelt, and sincere. I honestly felt like I was right there in the room with you, listening to a close friend share her innermost thoughts. When your eyes welled with tears, so did mine. No one on this platform, or any other, has ever made me feel that way. You are still so young and to have achieved this level of maturity is truly amazing and inspiring. I am 60 years old and I know people my age who have not obtained this much. Your parents must be incredibly proud of you (and Ali as well). I am proud of you and feel as though I have known you all my life. God bless you and your family. Stay safe.",Sherry Copeland,9 ay √∂nce,30

Once the pandemic hit and we had to 'reorganise' we way we live and the way we do things, it became apparent that some wants and needs were unnecessary and there were things we could do without and things that had more priority because they had more meaning in our lives! The stuff we once held dear were meaningless....so we discarded them. A simpler way of life beckoned and it felt good. Holding family and love ones dear were the priority, mental wellness was the priority, a sense of calm and stillness in what was the frenetic, commercial world was the priority.

"Hello Lydia, I truly love watching your videos but there is one thing you mentioned that caught my attention and I would like to share my thoughts on it. The masseter muscle Botox treatment. I am very delighted to hear that it has worked wonders for you. Headaches are really awful and the fact that you have been able to dramatically reduce your paracetamol use is amazing. However, I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about more natural options: especially as you mentioned that people close to you have decided to go for Botox. It‚Äôs important to remember that we are all different and Botox may not be essential for each individual (invasive).. better to have an assessment first. It could simply be tension of the face/jaw/neck or issues with the joints of these areas which are causing a misalignment in the upper body thereby causing extra tension. As an osteopath myself I would highly recommend anyone with jaw tension to try a more natural route like osteopathy or chiropractic before jumping into Botox. ",Yiashnee Vencat,9 ay √∂nce,4

"Lydia why don't you just use your big garden area to build an extra attachement just for working space purposes? That way you don't have to move and can stay in your beautiful home in which you had invested already so much (not just money). If you build an attachement maybe up to 20-30 square meters you will still have enough space in your garden, but have a seperate area only for your employees to work there. Because that's the main reason you want to move, isn't it? Just a thought.",Nadi M,9 ay √∂nce,0
