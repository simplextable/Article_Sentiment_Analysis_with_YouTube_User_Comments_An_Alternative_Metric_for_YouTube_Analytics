The walking to gym locker cut was incredible. Hannah your editing over the years has gotten so incredible :) I‚Äôm moving to nyc this summer to start my job post grad and I‚Äôm living vicariously through you until then,simsave,11 ay √∂nce,414
I feel like spring is the perfect time to ‚Äúget back on track‚Äù vs the beginning of the calendar year. Something I‚Äôve learned that has honestly changed my life is learning to work with the natural rhythm of the earth. Spring is all about new beginnings and bringing in fresh ideas. Take the first few months of the year after the holiday season for R&R and plan ahead for the year. Then implement new habits in the spring when we naturally feel more motivated!,Kristina Kellen,11 ay √∂nce,76

"I can totally relate to the structure part of school.
