So where your job can be done from home and your own situation makes it possible or desirable then it should be made possible by employers.",Jess K,10 ay √∂nce,2

Not all your followers can afford Hermes, as they are 5 figures, (over 10k) so while Hermes is a beautiful brand, it would be more interesting to incorporate others as inspiration and ideas for designers that are more obtainable.

"With all due respect Lydia, good things don't always happen to good people. This is the 3rd time you've made this statement in one of your videos and I cringe every time you say it. There is a war going on in the Ukraine and millions are being killed, and I'm sure they are all good people. There was a HORRIFIC evil event that happened in the states where a gunman killed 25 innocent children and some teachers. We all know that they are good people. Last year a dear friend of mine, who was really like an angel, one of the most incredible people you ever could meet was killed in a horrible terrifying accident - she was a really good person. If good things happen to good people, then bad things happen to bad people and...well...I'm sure I don't have to name some horrible well known people who get awards, millions and a seemingly have a great love life.  Just saying... Love you girl, but please know that this statement is BEYOND false. You seem to be a good person, and you lost your beautiful little Lynx. That was not a good thing.",stareye8,10 ay √∂nce,9
