"I feel like you and Ali should get ducks. I know you’ve talked about chickens before, and I agree, but I think you would enjoy the absolute hell out of ducks. They’re absolutely hilarious, they get on with dogs well, and their eggs are excellent for baking. Actually all waterfowl eggs are excellent for baking, for whatever reason they lend an extra kind of fluffiness to baking that normal eggs do not. Plus, ducklings bond with whoever they see first upon hatching so if a duckling bonds with you, it will literally follow you everywhere like a little feathered puppy. They also eat garden pests, like slugs and other nasties that might eat your beautiful produce. Just some food for thought. P.S I LOVE the silk sleeveless lemon dress on you. They’re both stunning honestly, but I think the sleeveless one is a lovely option for garden parties and the warmer weather.",Sarah,10 ay önce (düzenlendi),3

I always open them really carefully so if i would like to make a return i van repack it in the bag. Also because I hope that helps brands relisting the returned item again instead of throwing it away because that is horrible. But if you rip the bags, can you just still make an return?  And would that make a difference for a brand in relisting an item? Thanks.",Dutches 83,10 ay önce,0
