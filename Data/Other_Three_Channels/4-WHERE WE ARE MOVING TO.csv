"Excited for a potential future move to the Cotswolds! It fits your vibe perfectly. The other day, I came across this post on IG and it's a little long, but I think it's worth sharing because it seems like some other commenters are getting really hung up on 'how you could ever leave this house' and this notion that everything everyone does has to be FOREVER. So here it is: ",Jaclyn Salem,10 ay önce,367
Jeez Lydia - you can live wherever you want and you don’t have to explain why to anyone - I for one am excited about the whole process and I can’t wait ️,Kate McGovern,10 ay önce,171
"I so agree with Jaclyn… as somebody who has owned nine houses with my husband, I’m now 58, there been reasons why we have moved, but there is no law that the minute you live somewhere you have to live  forever. I actually kind of grin to myself when I hear people Who are younger and, even older, who say places are their “forever“ home. As a Christian, I always look at it as, as the Lord wills“, and he can move me anytime he wants to… I also need to check my heart why I’m moving, but moving in itself is not wrong. I love houses, I love redoing houses as well! And Lydia, I’m sure you will make a mint off of the home you live in now. You have done amazing things to it. So I say, cheers! And, I can’t wait to see what you end up in!",Lisa,8 ay önce,7

"I think it’s fine for you to live wherever you want, whether it be the Cotswolds or somewhere else, it’s natural for you to want to be closer to somewhere you feel you fit in, with a bit more convenience that being stuck in the middle of nowhere, where you don’t feel you do. Also natural to be nearer friends and or family. As for the friend they probably compared you to, it’s also natural that since you both share a similar aesthetic, lifestyle, interests, pets and job etc that you’d spend time with her as that’s what friends do, it certainly doesn’t mean your copying each other. If by chance you’ve been reading a certain site, I’d suggest not to as they’ll never accept you no matter what you do. Just live your life they way you want too.",Towhereverdreaminggoes,10 ay önce,19

I mean I take inspiration from my friends, that doesn’t mean I’m copying them. You are the product of the people you surround yourself with. We are drawn to people that share the same interests as us so no wonder it appears that we are all copying each other.

I have dealt with acne and the scarring it comes with for most of my life, it's a great source of insecurity for me and has led me to resent every bit of texture in my skin especially since we see mostly perfectly smooth skin on social media. I know it's silly and usually I do know better but the insecurity gets me every time so just that moment, seeing a beautiful woman like yourself with amazing skin and your absolutely normal skin texture was a nice reminder that no one is born with a blurring filter on their face and that this is completely normal.

"Be careful what you wish for! I once moved to a gated community,  beautiful area, love the aesthetic, it was perfection..... after a year of living there I could not get out fast enough.The sameness, the perfection of it all turned out to be somewhat of a guided cage. I felt stuck in a warp unable to change.  I moved and still live in a beautiful area, everyone's house is well cared for (albeit for one, and if truth be told I kind of like the resistance to change of the inhabitants) Everyone is at different stages in their lives, I love living here and and the feeling of being part of an every evolving 'landscape'  never makes me feel wedded to a certain aesthetic.

"Oh no I assumed because you loved The Holiday you had experienced the whole Nancy Meyers catalogue. As a designer I had many clients asking me to design their house like ""that movie with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson"". I was obsessed with that house too so knew exactly how to deliver their brief. My friend and I have watched it so many times we joke we could play each of the roles. Not sure if Kelly told you but the deli they go to when they are all shopping for dinner is Ina Garten's original famous deli and where her brand, The Barefoot Contessa, started. If you look back at it you'll see the deli bags hanging on the wall with her brand. Now I'm not going to assume you've watched ""Its Complicated"", another of Nancy's films. Meryl Streep's house and bakery in that are divine too. Watch that if you haven't already. On a trip to America I  actually hunted down the location of that house and drove past and soaked up the absolutely beautiful area it is in. That East Coast style of America you mentioned is very influenced from the English country style simply because its origins are English but now with their history and lifestyle giving it its own spin. Nancy's daughter wrote and directed ""Home Alone"" with Reece Witherspoon. You can see the influence, aesthetic and talent her mother has passed on. That house is a really lovely experience too! Lots to watch, enjoy! Oh and if you haven't watched any of The Barefoot Contessa cooking shows they are fab. I've lost many days escaping into Ina's kitchen. You'll fall in love with her and Jeffrey they are such a beautiful couple.",Di Hendy,10 ay önce,12

"Hi Lydia, great video, as someone who grew up in the area I recommend if trying Highclere castle again, maybe have tea in the coach house there or at Esseborne Manor afterwards. It is a country hotel about 15 min drive from Highclere. It’s where all the cast stayed so continues along the downton theme. The Highclere estate is beautiful there are some stunning lakes to walk around (easiest to drive to) and there are also beautiful Coachouses you can stay in. You can drive 5 mins to the village of burghclere where you can see the village hall which is used as the school in the show. I highly recommend The Pheasant country pub in Highclere.

I now know that you should decorate your house based on what your house lends it to.  For example, I live in the country but I was decorating kind of a more contemporary vibe which does not suit my house at all.  I love your style, whether that be clothing, decor, gardening, etc etc.  You have taught me a lot and I thank you for that.  So happy for you and all that you have achieved already!

This is your life and you don’t need to justify your decision to live it to the fullest.

I appreciate what you've said about your experience at Highclere Castle. Nothing wrong with giving POSITIVE constructive criticism that could potentially help someone do something better and even help them make more income and potentially improve things for them as a whole. Society is quickly becoming a place where we cannot give or receive correction however kindly and genuinely it may be given. That's a dangerous road to go down and it's time to re-normalize giving positive constructive criticism with the aim of helping each other.,Koko C,10 ay önce (düzenlendi),0

It's not bashing, it's more about what you thought it would be for such a historical place as Highclere Castle, but they have a different approach, doesn't mean they did it bad, just not what you and Carrie expected. And even if they aimed it at tourists, it is a historical place certain settings should be considered. My expectation was the same for that castle and I was surprised to see the plastic furniture as well as hear you speak about the cardbord box afternoon tea and having a high cost for it.

"Massages and accupuncture seem okay to me if it is done without chantings and rituals that you don't understand. As a christian myself some of these eastern practices have to be researched first before you incorporate it into your lifestyle. You mentioned your accupuncturist saying things that you didn't understand.  Please do your research, or at the very least ask what she is saying or chanting over you before she performs any precedure on you, no matter how positive you think it is!  These things can attract negative energy  around you.  The spiritual world is a  very real thing!  And if you don't know what you are dealing with it can hurt you in more ways than one!
