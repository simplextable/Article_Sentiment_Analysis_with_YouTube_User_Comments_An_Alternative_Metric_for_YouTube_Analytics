You would would have so many opportunities her and you have the personality to make friends anywhere. Heck, I will come down and get to know you if you‚Äôd like. By car it would take me anywhere from 3 1/2 hours to 4 if I drove but if I flew from Fresno to L.A. It would take about 45 minutes. I could easily see you as a California girl or Hawaii girl. Think about it. If you ever want to talk, whether its on the phone, texting, or email, let me know and I will give you my info. So glad you had a great time! ",@tracyolson2739,10 ay √∂nce,0
