"How LOVELY you are contained and so chill knowing the delivery person smashed your gate... CHILL GOALS.  I would charge out like a snarling bull dog but I much prefer your method of sending Ali.  Consider a wider inset or angled approach over a complete removal of what exists.  Planting a tree or hedge JUST there or even large boulders.  The polar vortex we endured altered my hedge growth pattern, thinning the base.  Realizing I am forever at the mercy of weather/light/water/or disease for uniformity has left me in a state of hedge MADNESS.  ~  AND...congrats on receiving the tears when you left.  That kind of heart filling is priceless.",B. Walker,9 ay önce,7

"fragrances will often smell different dependent on their application, so the same fragrance in a body lotion would smell different in a shower gel or face cream. It's likely they would have had to modify the fragrance to sit well within each application too, for stability purposes or discolouration too so it could be that it's the same scent with tweaks here and there to the formulation :)",Charlotte Matten,9 ay önce,13
