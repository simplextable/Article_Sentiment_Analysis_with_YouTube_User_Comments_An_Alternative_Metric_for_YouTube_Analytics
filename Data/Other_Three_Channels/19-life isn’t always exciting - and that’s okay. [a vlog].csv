Honestly the chill slow vlogs are always my favorite. You don’t have to constantly go out and be doing something exciting. Days of self care and reflection are just as important so I love this vlog ,Khalilah D.,10 ay önce,594

I'm living my best life vicariously through Hannah. Seeing how I sometimes wish I could have a chill day on my own in my own apartment like this but can't as I still live at home at the ripe age of 23. Vlogs like this one excite me. Now I'll go back to daydreaming about an imaginary apartment near the center of Amsterdam. I'm a real one ofc :),Wallflower,10 ay önce,59
"Your vlogs bring me back to my early twenties when I lived in Boston as a college/working kid. I’m an only child so I feel like I grew into the “living on my own” routine quite seamlessly, and everything you said about enjoying every bit of life (especially the simple, mundane stuff) cannot be truer. Grocery shopping, making home cooked meals, taking trips into the city, taking the whole day to explore… those were my best memories.    ",ARealCookinMama,10 ay önce (düzenlendi),32

I'm so proud to say that I am little by little getting used to do things on my own and I can already walk on the street without being nervous about what other people would think about me!

"Slow vlogs of content creators doing normal people shit (aka nothing) are the best. Seeing other people doing nothing and just doing life is my favorite content. Content creators have so much power and influence on people and I feel like they need to remind us that it's okay to not have to do something at all times. Most people could be like ""Oh ...well you don't have to be influenced by content creators so easily"" but really content creators are the new 'famous people' or 'influential people'. If you see 100% of content creators going out all the time... you're going to feel like you have to go out all the time or you're doing life wrong. I appreciate vlogs like this. They make me feel better about being at home and just being left alone. Especially after a 9-5??? yea no, you're not seeing me outside. Catch me hanging out with my dog.",Samantha Ochoa,10 ay önce,0

I find that actual carrots, not the baby carrots, have a much better flavor.  if you like chicken fajitas, sluce up a red, gree, and yellow pepper, a large onion, and put on the bottom if your crock pot. Next, lay 2-3 chicken breasts on top of that. Next, sprinkle a packet of fajita seasoning over that, than cover with a large jar of salsa. Cook on low for 7-8 hours. Shred up chicken, mix all ingredients. I use soft taco shells, sour cream cheese, etc. Yum!!!",Jan Carlson,10 ay önce,1
